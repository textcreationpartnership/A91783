            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He Author hereof, Mr. <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander Richardſon,</hi> was a man of tranſcendent parts, and moſt ſublimate intellectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als, whereby he attained unto ſuch a perfection in all Arts and Sciences, that there is nothing almoſt of liberal and ingenuous literature, which he had not in-ſight into; and that ſuch as to be able to lay down a ſyſteme of it in moſt exact and methodical Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts: and had his Abilities been drawn forth to the full advantage, doubtleſs the Arts had received a conſiderable improvement beyond what the world hath yet been acquainted with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al. But ſo it is, that what by his want of Health, and what by the ſingular modeſty of his Diſpoſition (known unto them that knew him) the Common-wealth of Learning hath
<pb facs="tcp:115576:3"/> been deprived of ſo great a felicity. Neither yet did he envy others the Fruits of his own A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilities, but was alwayes most ready to impart and communicate what he knew; which thoſe of his time (divers of whom are ſtill ſurviving) knew very well how to make good uſe of: For though he was but Maſter of Arts, (and not Fellow) of <hi>Queens Colledge,</hi> yet did divers Graduates from ſeveral Colledges flock unto his <hi>Lectures,</hi> and what he freely diſcourſed unto them in ſeveral Sciences, they as eagerly took from his mouth in writing, and then communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated unto others; which found ſuch general acceptance, that happy was he who could make himſelf Maſter of <hi>Richardſon's</hi> Notes, which they refuſed not to purchaſe at any pains in tranſcribing. For indeed they could eaſily perceive in him a reach beyond ordinary men, and that his words carried further; he dived deep, even unto the bottom of Entity, while o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers did but <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, and lick the Glaſs. But among many other Notes of his thoſe of his Commentary on <hi>Ramus</hi> Logick were most
<pb facs="tcp:115576:3"/> generally prized and made uſe of by young Students: whereof (though long ſince printed) there are many Copies in Manuſcript ſtill in being; and indeed it was his Logick whereby, as by a Key, he opened the ſecrets of all other Arts and Sciences, to the admiration of all that heard him. I have therfore adventured upon this <hi>Second Impreſsion,</hi> and have added to it his <hi>Prelections</hi> on <hi>Ramus</hi> his <hi>Grammer, Taleus</hi> his <hi>Rhetorick;</hi> alſo his Notes on <hi>Phyſicks, Ethicks, Aſtronomy, Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine,</hi> and <hi>Opticks,</hi> which I doubt not but they will meet with thy Acceptance proportionable to their worth, whereby I may be Encouraged to offer to thy view ſuch other of his Works, as I can meet withal, which do yet ſleep (as theſe have done hitherto) in the hands of Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate men.</p>

<pb n="6" facs="tcp:115576:7"/> matter, <hi>ergo</hi> he is truly ſpiritual, for ſo we account things ſpiritual, according to the ſubtleneſs of their matter, but he hath no matter at all: Again he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing without matter and form, <hi>ergo</hi> can be no <hi>mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brum,</hi> becauſe every member containeth a portion of matter and form, neither can he be an <hi>integrum,</hi> becauſe that conſiſteth of members, which contain part of matter and form.

                  </gap>, and above our Logick: again, in that he is abſolutely firſt he muſt needs be without accidents (to uſe their term) without adjuncts, for they are ſecond things ariſing from their ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, and <hi>in abſolute primo ente</hi> there muſt be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, but that which is <hi>abſolute primum:</hi> ſo that here we ſee his moſt ſimple being, and that he is beyond our Logick. Now if he be without all <hi>poten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia,</hi> both <hi>eſſentialis,</hi> and <hi>accidentalis,</hi> he is pure act; ſo that this act now of his muſt needs be his <hi>eſſe,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he is pure act, for if he be <hi>agere,</hi> then his <hi>eſſe</hi> and <hi>agere</hi> are the ſame: ſo that if any one doth any thing. as every <hi>ens a primo</hi> doth by <hi>potentia,</hi> it is not pure act: ſome ſay the Angels do <hi>agere per eſſentiam,</hi> but it is falſe, unleſs they mean that they act firſt by <hi>potentia:</hi> now indeed there is nothing, but it doth act <hi>per faoultatem eſſentiae.</hi> Firſt the form, that is the beginner of act, and when it acts upon matter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal, that is habitual, or a faculty, when it acts by

Now we find then, that this <hi>primum ens</hi> muſt be <hi>actus,</hi> and <hi>purus actus,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there is no <hi>potentia</hi> in him at all, <hi>ergo</hi> it muſt needs be, that he is <hi>primus actus, ergo optimus actus.</hi> for <hi>primus actus,</hi> and <hi>optimus actus</hi> are all one: A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain hence it muſt needs follow, that if there be any act of other things, it muſt needs be from him, and therefore if there be any thing <hi>actu</hi> it muſt be from him: ſo then thus we have found him abſolute in every thing.</p>

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> in every thing, becauſe though all things at the beginning were made for one man, yet by reaſon of ſin ſince his fall, one cannot ſee all things, therefore there muſt be a carrier from one man to another, that which one man ſees with his eye of Logick, he may utter it to another: ſo that <gap reason="foreign">

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> is either <hi>loquentia</hi> or <hi>eloquentia:</hi> the reaſon of this diſtribution is this, we heard be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that ſpeech was a carrier from man to man: and becauſe things that are reported, are not ſo eaſily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, as thoſe which are ſeen by our eye of Logick, <hi>ergo</hi> it was requiſite that there ſhould not onely be an <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, whereby things might be uttered, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo a fine ſuggering of them with Rhetorick, for the more eaſie receiving of them.</p>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:115576:10"/>
               <p> 
                  <hi>Eloquentia</hi> is either more fine or more grave, that is, <hi>ſoluta,</hi> or <hi>ligata:</hi> the reaſon is this, <hi>argumentum</hi> is <hi>artificiale,</hi> or <hi>inartificiale:</hi> now becauſe ſpeech is an artificial argument, and ſo not eaſily received, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Rhetorick ſerves to deliver the matter more ſoberly and gravely; and Poetry yet makes it more fine, where all things muſt be done by meaſure and ſweet ſounds.</p>
               <p>So that now we ſee how theſe general Arts are <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>: and that they are not of ſo great neceſſity in reſpect of the thing, as in regard of us for our good: for, ſo as every thing is made for man, ſo he muſt ſee them for his good, by that rule that they are crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>
               <p>Theſe now though they be <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> becauſe they are circumſtantial, yet they are <hi>ab ente primo,</hi> becauſe there are cauſes, effects, ſubjects, adjuncts, &amp;c. and ſpeech <hi>in ente a primo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> is either quantity or quality, the reaſon is this, every <hi>ens a primo</hi> is finite, <hi>ergo</hi> muſt needs have limits of quantity, if he have limits of eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence.</p>
               <p>Quantity is either diſcreet, or continued, for if every thing be finite, then it muſt be diſcreet, or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct from any other. Again, as it is diſcreet, ſo it is continued, ſo farre as the form extendeth the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, whereby we may ſee how farre it reacheth, and where it reacheth not. Now as there is quantity, ſo alſo there muſt be quality in every thing, for there is no <hi>ens a primo</hi> that is pure act, <hi>ergo</hi> it hath a form acting upon a matter, and thence proceed all quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tities. Again, it being made for an end, muſt there fore act unto its end.</p>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:115576:10"/>
               <p> 
                  <hi>Qualitas eſt natura, &amp; bonitas,</hi> every thing hath nature, becauſe it hath a matter and a form, <hi>ergo</hi> there is nature in every thing. And therefore <hi>Ramus</hi> ſaith, <hi>Forma eſt praecipua rerum natura:</hi> and the Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers call <hi>forma principium actionis,</hi> and <hi>materia principium paſsionis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now this <hi>ens</hi> being of this ſcantling for quantity, and of this nature for act, muſt be good for Gods glory: ſo that every thing hath a goodneſs in it. Again, were all things made for man, and muſt he ſee them with his reaſon? Yes: <hi>ergo</hi> they are good for him: <hi>ergo</hi> he muſt have a will to imbrace them as <hi>bona,</hi> as well as an eye of reaſon to ſee them as <hi>vera,</hi> and ſo man alſo is made for God, as his will acts goodneſs.</p>
               <p>Now for the order of theſe, <hi>actus</hi> is before <hi>actum,</hi> for the one is <hi>actio,</hi> the other is <hi>paſsio,</hi> and <hi>actio</hi> is before <hi>paſsio,</hi> and is more excellent then it. Again, <hi>actus</hi> doth <hi>concreſcere</hi> with it ſelf, and with the <hi>actum</hi> that is in the thing: <hi>ergo, actus</hi> is more general; <hi>ergo</hi> is before <hi>actum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Again, becauſe we do not give names to things but with reaſon from ſome argument of Logick in the thing: and again, becauſe there muſt be an <hi>actus</hi> from the thing to man, before there can be an <hi>actus</hi> from man to man, therefore the <hi>Logiſmos</hi> in the thing muſt be before the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> in it; <hi>ergo</hi> Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick is the moſt general, and firſt in order of all Arts.</p>
               <p>Of thoſe things that are <hi>acta,</hi> quantity is firſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it ariſeth nexly from the matter and form of a thing: for firſt of all the matter and form limit the thing, when they are put together, before they act any thing, and afterward they act one upon the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:115576:11"/> Now quality, that is the act of the form upon the matter; <hi>ergo,</hi> it is after quantity, but before goodneſs, becauſe that is the end of Natures act. For ſeeing quantity ariſeth immediately from the matter and form of a thing, and Nature from the act of the form upon the matter: therefore goodneſs muſt be the laſt, as being the end of all the former: and thus did the Lord make all things, firſt making the cauſes effects of things, then impoſing ſpeech on them, then number, then meaſuring them by Geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metry, how farre their magnitude ſhould reach, and where it ſhould not reach, before it ſhould act. Now this act of Nature was to go no further upon exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal objects, but onely be acted by the form upon the matter; whereas the moral act of goodneſs was to go further, for that is for God. Again, Nature is the next in moſt thing to quantity, and Goodneſs is laſt. And thus have we ſeen all that is <hi>in ente a primo,</hi> which is the ground of all Arts.</p>

               <p>Now we are come to Arts, and firſt we are to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin with Encuclopaidia, and the definition of it. Firſt for the name, it is <hi>Orbis ille, &amp; Circulus Artium.</hi> The reaſon of it indeed is as much as Arts quite through, as we uſe to ſay when there are many poor folk to be ſerved, though they ſtand in a long row, Have you ſerved them round? But there is a further reaſon of it, A circle we know is a round line, whoſe beginning and end meet together in a common point; therefore this learning in a Circle muſt be ſhewed to have a common point, and that we ſhall eaſily find. The proper ſubject of Art is <hi>Ens a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo,</hi>
                  <pb n="15" facs="tcp:115576:11"/> becauſe we heard, that was made for an end. Now then from whence <hi>Ens a primo</hi> had his beginning, from thence muſt <hi>Ars</hi> have his beginning: But from <hi>Ens primum</hi> it had his beginning, <hi>ergo.</hi> Again, as <hi>Ens a primo</hi> hath for his beginning <hi>Ens primum,</hi> ſo it muſt have <hi>Ens primum</hi> for his laſt end, becauſe <hi>Ens primum</hi> is not made for any end, but is the laſt end of all things it ſelf, <hi>ergo</hi> he muſt alſo be the laſt end of Art: Then here we find, as <hi>Ens primum</hi> is the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of Art, ſo alſo he is the end of Art; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he is the beginning and end of thoſe things that are the ſubjects of Arts; therefore there is one common point wherein they begin and end: <hi>ergo</hi> having the ſame beginning and end, here is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. Now howſoever the phraſe may ſeem otherwiſe, as we heard before, yet here we ſee the wiſdom of God in this name, though the Grae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians did not know the reaſon of it when they gave it. Now the Scripture ſeemeth to witneſs this truth. For the Lord ſaith, <hi>I am the beginning and the end:</hi> that is, of things, and again, <hi>I am Alpha and Omega:</hi> theſe belong to Grammar, <hi>ergo</hi> to Art, <hi>ergo</hi> he is both the beginning and end of things, and the Alpha and Omega of the Arts.</p>
               <p>That this wiſdom is round, we may alſo ſee in regard of the ſubject; for the World is round, and that is the ſubject of Art: <hi>ergo</hi> Art is ſo, for Art is an adjunct to it, and every adjunct takes figure of his ſubject. Again, if we will take Art for Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, Knowledge is in a mans head, and that is round, ſo <hi>Encuclopaidia</hi> is every way <hi>in circulo:</hi> and thus we ſee the reaſon, why this name ſhould be given to a Chain, whoſe links are the Arts. Now if <hi>Ens primum</hi> be the cauſe of <hi>entia a primo,</hi> then he
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:115576:12"/> hath the Idea of them in him: for he made them by counſel, and not by neceſſity; for then he ſhould have needed them, and they have a parelion of that wiſdom that is in his Idea. Again, it muſt needs be that this wiſdom is his, becauſe he governs them by the rules of Art, for ſo every rule of Art is a Statute-law of God, by which he made the things, and whereby he governs the things, whoſe Art it is. Now ſeeing it is ſo, therefore this Law hath God for the Author, and look what Idea was in the making of the thing, the ſame Idea is in the governing of it: for if the Lord ſhould make it by one rule, and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern it by another, it would not ſerve the turn to guide the thing to the <hi>eupraxie,</hi> whereunto it was made. So that hence it follows, that every rule of Art is eternal. Again, our rule of Logick tels us, that every rule of Art is moſt true, and therefore is from God. For ſo every rule is true, as it anſwers to that Idea that is in him: and is moſt juſt, moſt wiſe; <hi>ergo</hi> is from God, who is moſt true, moſt juſt, and moſt wiſe. Now it is in God as in the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, and it is in the creature too, but there it is by a refraction: for this wiſdom coming to the creature, according as the creature is, ſuch is the Arts order and courſe. So that if <hi>ens a primo</hi> be divided into parts, this wiſdom alſo will be divided into parts: and as in a Looking-glaſs that is broken, look how many peices it is broken into, ſo many images ſhall you ſee: So for the Arts, look into how many parts the thing is divided, into ſo many parts will the Art be diſtributed.</p>

               <p>The Chain <hi>Encuclopaidia</hi> is not a <hi>genus</hi> to <hi>Ars,</hi> no more than a Chain is a <hi>genus</hi> to the Links, but an <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrum:</hi> for as a Chain is an <hi>integrum,</hi> and the Links <hi>membra;</hi> ſo <hi>Encuclopaidia</hi> is an <hi>integrum,</hi> and the Arts are the members that make up the whole. Now as the links muſt be linked together, before there be a Chain: ſo the Arts muſt be holden together, before there be <hi>Encuclopaidia:</hi> ſo that every Art is a link, and they muſt be linked together to make up the whole. Therefore I ſay, <hi>qua continentur,</hi> as parts, <hi>conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nentur a toto.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For Arts may be holden together; for there is that community among the Arts, for <hi>Ars in genere</hi> is <hi>genus</hi> to them all: Therefore as <hi>Tully</hi> ſaith, they have a certain commonkinred, as being <hi>ſpecies</hi> of one <hi>genus:</hi> but this holding together is after ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther manner then links in a Chain: namely, <hi>pro ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinatione finium:</hi> Therefore they are not holden together confuſedly, and as they come to hand, but every one muſt have his rank according to the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality of the end thereof. So that if we link Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar on the Chain before Logick, we do not right:
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:115576:13"/> and ſo in like ſort for the other Arts.</p>
               <p>I ſay, <hi>qua omnes artes,</hi> becauſe as a Chain that hath not all his links, is not perfect, becauſe it wants ſome parts: ſo the Chain of Arts will not be perfect, if there be any wanting; the rule of Logick teacheth us ſo much: for <hi>Encuclopaidia</hi> is a <hi>totum, ergo</hi> if any <hi>member</hi> be wanting, there will not be a <hi>totum</hi> made up.

                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> It is no <hi>genus</hi> of Art, neither is <hi>Ars qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenus</hi> it is Art in the thing a vertue; but as it is <hi>ſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entia</hi> in mans head, ſo indeed it belongs to the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thicks: for if <hi>virtue</hi> were a <hi>genus</hi> to <hi>Ars,</hi> vertue be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to Ethicks: and ſo by this reaſon. Ethicks ſhould be the moſt general Art, and alſo by that rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon Ethicks ſhould be under Ethicks: for <hi>virtus in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellectualis</hi> is but a little part of them, therefore this is <hi>fallacia accidentis,</hi> as they call it.</p>
               <p>Again, to call it an habit as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſaith it is, and as the Schooles make it, that conceit is very ſimple, for <hi>habitus</hi> or <hi>quantitas habitualis</hi> belongeth to Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick, and is nothing but a ſpecial kind of adjunct:
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:115576:14"/> therefore <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> doth define <hi>homo</hi> to be <hi>genus ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionale,</hi> whereas we know <hi>genus</hi> is but an adjunct to <hi>animal,</hi> which is the <hi>genus</hi> of <hi>homo:</hi> ſo that it is not Art in the thing, but the knowledge he hath of it, which is adjoyned to man. Now we have heard, that Art is the wiſdom of God, <hi>in ente a primo,</hi> and the frame of the creature is in the antitype of this wiſdom, and is a ſubject of Art. I ſay, <hi>Ars eſt quae conſtat,</hi> though it be the frame of the thing. Now <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtare</hi> is to ſtand together in parts.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> How come Arts to have parts, being but that one wiſdom in God?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Not in regard of God, but in reſpect of the frame of the thing where we ſee it. For even as Gods Mercy and Juſtice are one, but various in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the object: It is Mercy to him that comes before him in Chriſt; It is Juſtice to him that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares before him without Chriſt: So Art is one in God, but is various in reſpect of the various work it hath wrought in the creation of things, and that it acteth in their government to their end. Again, thoſe parts muſt <hi>conſtare,</hi> for in the frame of the thing the ſubjects of the Arts do <hi>conſtare, ergo</hi> this wiſdom fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing them muſt <hi>conſtare</hi> in his parts: and as one thing hath his frame, and another his, differing from the other; hence the precepts of Arts muſt be vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and muſt <hi>conſtare</hi> one with another; hence it follows, that in Art we muſt have no rules but thoſe that will <hi>conſtare,</hi> and are eſſential to it. So that if we bring a rule of Grammar into Logick, or <hi>econtra:</hi> or if we leave out of Logick ſome eſſential rule to it, it will not <hi>conſtare:</hi> again, if the rules of Art be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordered, they will not ſtand together: therefore when I ſay <hi>conſtare,</hi> I ſay two things, firſt that every
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:115576:14"/> Art muſt have all the rules that are eſſential to it, and no more: and ſecondly, that every precept muſt be placed in his due order, and rank. For as a Painter that makes the picture of a man would make it very deformed, if he ſhould ſet the head where the feet ſhould be, or <hi>contra:</hi> ſo were it as abſurd for an Artiſt to diſorder his Art.</p>

               <p>Every thing hath his ſpecial acts before it can work that main act, for which it was made, as reaſon muſt have two parts, it muſt ſee the ſimple cauſes, effects, ſubjects, adjuncts, &amp;c. and Axiomes, Syllogiſmes and Method, that it may <hi>bene diſſerere,</hi> therefore there are many petty acts of reaſon to be performed, which though they all conſpire in one main act, yet are they not one another: and here we ſee, that as Arts did ariſe from the frame of the thing; ſo the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts of Art are from the Acts of things: ſo that thus Arts <hi>conſtant praeceptis</hi> or <hi>regulis,</hi> all is one, both are good, and <hi>regere</hi> is as large as <hi>regula,</hi> and <hi>praecep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum</hi> as <hi>praecipere.</hi> But my reaſon why <hi>I</hi> rather chuſe <hi>praeceptum</hi> is this, becauſe <hi>regula</hi> is tropical, for it is often taken for a Square or Ruler, whereby we rule any thing, and this is a grand Synecdoche.

Now man not being able to take this wiſdom from God, which is moſt ſimple, therefore it hath pleaſed the Lord to place it in the things, and as flowers do ſend out a ſcent, or odor that doth affect our ſenſe of ſmelling, ſo every precept of Art doth <hi>ſpirare</hi> a ſweet ſcience to our glaſs of Underſtanding, which is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed that irradiation, which we heard of in Divinity in the Creation of things: but it is called <hi>ſcientia</hi> by a Trope, for as the ſcent of a flower is not properly odor, but that that doth affect the ſenſe; and as when we ſee a ſtrange thing, we ſay, look what a ſight is yonder, whereas ſight is properly of the eye: ſo we call Art a <hi>ſcientia,</hi> or ſweet ſavour in reſpect of our knowledge of it, which is a metonimy of the adjunct for the Subject.</p>

                  </gap>, and <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, but they belong to every Art, therefore muſt be taught <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>: and again, there is <hi>geneſis</hi> and <hi>analyſis</hi> of one and the ſame axiom, as when I ſeek for a cauſe, or any other argument to make an axiome, or when I reſolve it into a cauſe, &amp;c. ſo that when I ask, what is Latine for ſuch a word, I geniſe it, and engliſhing it I analyſe it, ſo that they belong not to method, which is a diſpoſition, for they may be of one word; again, they may be as well of any other rule as of method. Now becauſe they did obſerve the <hi>analyſis</hi> and <hi>geneſis</hi> in method more uſually, than of art in general, therefore they thought them to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long onely to it; now indeed if I take any rule of art from other rules of art, I practiſe method, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they may be ſpecial practiſes of method, for as [ſaid before, they may be in any other rule of Art, as
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:115576:19"/> well as in it. And method is not double becauſe of them, no more than any rule of Art is double, becauſe of the double uſe of it, and theſe are the life of Art, therefore thoſe that will be expert for practiſe of any Art, let them practiſe theſe. Now for the general Arts, I think none will doubt, but that they belong to them, but for the ſpecial Arts there may be ſome doubt. If you draw any deduction from any firſt rule of any ſpecial Art, it is <hi>geneſis;</hi> or if you draw deduction unto a firſt rule from it, it is <hi>analyſis, &amp;c.</hi> So when you examine the Suns courſe by the rule of Aſtronomy, it is <hi>geneſis, analyſis contra.</hi> This <hi>analyſis</hi> if it be imitated (for ſo it pleaſeth the Lord to let us reſolve his creatures) that we may work alike, that is called <hi>imitatio:</hi> ſo that thoſe that have writ ſo much of <hi>imitatio,</hi> are to bring it hither, and <hi>imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio</hi> is general, as we imitate ſome <hi>analyſis</hi> of ſome thing that is geniſed. And indeed all our practice is nothing but <hi>geneſis</hi> imitative of <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>: ſo a child when he writes a copy by his Maſters example doth imitate him, for firſt he looks at the line then at the ſentences, then at the words, and laſtly at the letters. So an apprentiſe when he works according as his maſter reacheth him, doth imitate his example: and thus as we ſee Gods wiſdom making up the thing, ſo we ſee mans work in imitating God.</p>

Now this uſe may be confuſed with the <hi>prattomena</hi> of other Arts; ſo that this rule is here to be taught, that the Arts for their precepts are diſtinct, but not for the uſe of their <hi>prattomena:</hi> for uſe holds the <hi>prattomena</hi> of Arts together, as in this example, all fleſh is graſs, if it be examined. For in this there is the <hi>prattomenon</hi> of Logick, Grammar, Rhetorick, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Philoſophy, and laſtly the <hi>prattomenon</hi> of Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.

Now true it is, that this, as alſo the <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap> proceed from the thing in nature; yet Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick is more general than any of the reſt in regard of his uſe, for it is in it ſelf in ſpeech, in quantity, &amp;c. ſo that look where any art is, there Logick is: but it doth not follow, that where Logick is, there Arith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metick, Geometry, &amp;c. ſhould be. Again, it pleaſed the Lord to make man his Steward under him over all the Creatures, <hi>ergo</hi> in this reſpect it is neceſſary he ſhould behold all the creatures, to the imployment of the uſe of the principal Lord, therefore he muſt firſt ſee them, therefore muſt be prepared with ſuch a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty, that he may ſee all things by it.

                  <p>Again, for <hi>Apodictica,</hi> which is <hi>de neceſſariis,</hi> that belongs to a neceſſary axiome, for no ſyllogiſmes are neceſſary, but the axiomes which they conſiſt of; but the ſyllogiſtical judgement is the ſame both of neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary and contingent axiomes, and a ſyllogiſme of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingent propoſitions is neceſſary as well as that, which is of neceſſary axioms.

<pb n="41" facs="tcp:115576:24"/> and whereas they alledge that it is of the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parency of truth, what care I for that? yet it is counterfeit: ſo that they would have all Logick to conſiſt in a neceſſary and a contingent axiome, for no ſyllogiſmes are ſo: and that is the reaſon, that <hi>Ramus</hi> denies that demonſtration; for their neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary that they ſpeak of, is in axiom, not in ſyllogiſme.

<pb n="47" facs="tcp:115576:27"/> comes it to be divided into branches?

                     </gap> and reaſon according to his frame hath theſe two operations, <hi>invenire</hi> and <hi>judicare,</hi> therefore the Art being the Idea of this frame, that hath two parts, muſt have two parts, for Logick behold reaſon, not as it is a faculty belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to natural Philoſophy, but as it acts. Now thus I argue. If reaſons frame run into two heads, or actions, that it may <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, then the Art muſt do ſo, now that reaſon is framed to run into theſe two heads, thus I ſhewed it, All things were made for man, therefore he muſt have an eye to ſee them: now all things that God hath made are conſidered in themſelves, or with others, for the world is one conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting of many parts, and they are conſidered alone or with others, therefore mans reaſon muſt run accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly. God onely is entire in himſelf having no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to any other thing, he is ſimple, and hath no parts, therefore he is not liable to Logick: all other things are compoſed, that it might appear, that he is ſimple, ſo that every thing elſe is compoſed, or diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with others, yet firſt it muſt be in it ſelf, in uſe: for if I ſay a brick-wall, there muſt needs firſt be bricks, and what uſe have we of words alone in Grammar, but in Syntax, and firſt we muſt ſee the Etimologie of them: nay in every Art except Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torick there is no uſe of the firſt part without the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, neither is invention ever without judgement, therefore when every thing hath his double conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, there muſt be two parts of reaſon, for as
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:115576:28"/> things are, ſo muſt reaſons act be, for every thing muſt be ſo adminiſtred as that it be liable to reaſon, and be conſidered alone before it be diſpoſed: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore invention is firſt, ſo that any man that hath rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon will acknowledge the neceſſity of this diſtribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: now theſe two parts are called Invention and Diſpoſition. Firſt for the reaſon of the name Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, man was to ſee all Gods creatures, and ſo to ſee his order in them: now how ſhould man ſee them? were they written in his underſtanding? no more than <hi>Pauls</hi> ſteeple is in my eye, for man came furniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into the world onely with Logick, Grammar, Rhetorick and Divinity, neither with the knowledge of theſe Arts, but with the faculties of them, and therefore the Arts muſt needs be there, for we read the Arts in the things: ſo that for Arithmetick, Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ometry and nature, man was to learn them by the creatures, as he was alſo to learn the knowledge of Logick, Grammar, Rhetorick and Divinity. The reaſon is this, the <hi>Geneſis</hi> of every thing is Gods, and man muſt ſee the rules of Art, therefore man muſt ſee them from ſingulars, by <hi>analyſis:</hi> now then if man muſt learn theſe, and know them by his ſenſes obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, induction and experience, then he muſt ſeek, and find out theſe, for they are not written in him: again, whereas every thing is in diſpoſition, it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite that man find them out, and ſee them ſeveral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, therefore in this reſpect is this Art of reaſon cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Invention, namely as he is ſent by God to find out theſe things in his creatures; now if man muſt find them out with this act of his eye of reaſon, then is it fitly called invention, <hi>at, ergo.</hi> And this teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth man thus much, that he is to ſeek out, and find this wiſdom of God in the world, and not to be idle; for
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:115576:28"/> the world, and the creatures therein are like a book wherein Gods wiſdom is written, and there muſt we ſeek it out. Why is not this firſt Art called Diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, becauſe that is more familiar, and eaſie to us, for all things are diſpoſed; but we are by this Art to ſever them, and to look at them ſimply, ſo that this name teacheth man what he is to do in this act of his reaſon, namely, <hi>invenire argumenta,</hi> as in miſts to look at the elements, &amp;c. Now <hi>Kickerman</hi> cannot away with this diſtribution, and yet ſayes nothing to this purpoſe againſt it, for I ſuppoſe Invention to be an ambiguous name, and have equivocation with it, as I do not deny, but it is taken ſometimes for judgement, but that is tropically, yet while my Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor tels me what it is, that is ſufficient to know his meaning how here it is taken.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> But Invention is never without judgement ſaith he, no inventions uſe is ever without judgements uſe: ſo he may ſay Etimologie is never without Syntax, I but, ſaith he, you cannot invent without judgement, therefore they are no parts of Logick? as for example, a cheſt is made of wood, by this rule <hi>materia eſt cauſae ex qua res eſt,</hi> therefore here is ſyllogiſtical judgement, which is concluded <hi>a defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tione,</hi> and this is <hi>Ariſtotles</hi> demonſtration, as if you ſhould make a ſyllogiſme thus, That whereof the thing is, that is <hi>materia,</hi> But wood is that <hi>ex quo</hi> the Cheſt is, <hi>ergo.</hi> But here is onely Logicks practiſe, and not any rule of Art taught us. The queſtion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt <hi>Ramus</hi> and him is, whether any rule of inventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on belongs to judgement. This it is, the rules of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention give precepts of nothing at all concerning judgement, <hi>aut contra:</hi> therefore theſe are the true parts of Logick: and whilſt he argues from the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:115576:29"/> to the rule, it is <hi>fallacia accidentis,</hi> as if he ſhould reaſon: <hi>Socrates eſt animal, animal eſt genus, ergo Socrates eſt genus;</hi> whereas we know the thing <hi>ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal</hi> is not that Logical notion, neither <hi>Socrates,</hi> for they belong to natural Philoſophy, but <hi>genus</hi> is no adjunct attributed unto them, ſo this invention is onely of ſimple arguments, and of the ſimple conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of them, and therefore our Art runs along according to Gods order, and though we cannot pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice any rule of invention, but by judgement, yet it doth not therefore follow that they are the ſame, for it is as if he ſhould ſay this, <hi>homo, quae pars orationis? Nomen,</hi> here is the practiſe of Syntax, <hi>ergo</hi> Etimolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy, and Syntax, are all one.</p>

                  <p>We have heard of the reaſon of the name Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, why it is given to the firſt part, and that with great reaſon, for we muſt find by much ſeeking be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we can ſee things. Again, Logick being the firſt help to ſee Gods wiſdom in his creatures, and this uſe of invention being to be found in the thing, it is hard to find, therefore it is fitly called invention from the act of it: So again in diſpute, a man is fain to ſeek a third argument to prove his queſtion.

So that ſyllogiſtical judgement is to make clear that, which axiomatical judgement could not, yet the doctrine of <hi>axioma</hi> is before, and ſyllogiſtical judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment hath for his ſubject <hi>axioma dubium.</hi> The ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions againſt this rule are theſe: firſt, <hi>Kickerman</hi> ſaith, There is no invention, but there is judgement withal, that is confeſſed to be true in uſe, as in Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar the uſe of Etimologie is never without Syntax, but the uſe is one thing, and the rule another: there
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:115576:30"/> is no precept of invention, that belongs to judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment <hi>aut contra:</hi> then he ſaith, Who can invent, but he muſt alſo judge? for (ſaith he) muſt not a man judge a cauſe before he find it? this is alſo a fallace of uſe: we cannot find a rule, but we uſe both in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention and judgement, but by his argument, there ſhould be no judgement, but ſyllogiſtical: then again he ſaith, invention was uſed for a third argument, and not as <hi>Ramus</hi> taketh it.</p>
                  <p>True it is, the Schools thought it onely to belong to ſyllogiſmes, and that there was but the uſe of an argument, not the doctrine of it, but thus I argue: Is invention of a third argument, <hi>ergo,</hi> it is of an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, <hi>ergo,</hi> then it belongs not to judgement: for the doctrine of a ſimple conceit, as he calls it, is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct from the doctrine of judgement.

Now for his diſtribution into three parts, it comes to one with ours, for his firſt part <hi>terminus ſimplex,</hi> ſo much of it as is Logick belongs to invention, ſo <hi>terminus complexus</hi> belongs to axiomatical judgement, and <hi>diſcurſus</hi> to ſyllogiſmes, and he would have it belong to method too.

Now he proſecutes <hi>vox,</hi> and ſayes it is to be lookt at <hi>ad modum ſignificationis,</hi> or <hi>jure ſignificata,</hi> or the like: <hi>ad modum ſignificationis</hi> is <hi>categorematica,</hi> or <hi>ſuncate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorematica,</hi> as <hi>homo:</hi> becauſe, ſaith he, it ſignifies that thing, which may be an argument: why <hi>homo</hi> doth not ſignifie an argument, it belongs to natural Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:115576:33"/> and the argument is but an affection to the thing that <hi>homo</hi> ſignifies, but what reaſon is there that <hi>homo</hi> ſhould come into Logick, becauſe it names the thing that is <hi>categorematica?</hi> it is <hi>fallacia accidentis:</hi> that meat you bought on Saturday, you did eat on Sunday; but it was raw meat you bought on Satur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, <hi>ergo.</hi> But for <hi>vox</hi> therefore it comes not into Logick, onely there are <hi>conjugata</hi> and <hi>notatio,</hi> which belong to Logick, not becauſe they ſignifie things, for there is not in them any reſpect of the thing, and the name, but in conjugates how one name is deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from another, and in notation the reaſon of the name from ſome argument.

Now true it is this diſtribution is an old ſaid ſaw, but there is no ſuch thing, it is the ſame <hi>fallace ab accidente. Homo</hi> and <hi>genus</hi> do not ſignifie the ſame thing, <hi>homo</hi> is <hi>primae intentionis</hi> at the firſt hand, <hi>genus</hi> of the ſecond, but <hi>genus</hi> doth not ſignifie the ſame that <hi>homo</hi> doth: again <hi>genus</hi> hath his ſignificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as well as <hi>homo,</hi> that appears thus, becauſe it hath a diſtinct definition from <hi>homo,</hi> therefore they are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct <hi>re:</hi> ſo that <hi>genus</hi> is <hi>primae intentionis,</hi> to the thing it names, as <hi>homo</hi> is <hi>primae</hi> to that thing it names.

The world of Logicians doth imagine, that <hi>Architas Tarentinus</hi> was the firſt inventor of them, and taught them to his Scholler <hi>Pythagoras,</hi> now the reaſon that brought them in was this, that they might be furniſhed with matter to work about Logick. So that they were ſtore-houſes for them to lay up things one way or other, either <hi>analogice</hi> or <hi>a latere.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Kickerman</hi> approves that purpoſe of them, for ſaith he, things do not belong to Logick, now the Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick in a predicament is this, the order of things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing placed one before another, and ſo he ſaith the predicaments are of great uſe, for the finding of ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples: Secondly they conduce for <hi>terminus complexus,</hi> becauſe we ſee what may be a ſubject, and a predicate in a propoſition: then another uſe of them (he ſayes) is for <hi>diſcurſus,</hi> for when we know what is above, and below, we may quickly know what is in the middeſt; and they are alſo of uſe for method.</p>
                  <p>For the firſt Invention of them, they are not ſtore-houſes, for there is nothing but hath an <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="62" facs="tcp:115576:35"/> but I muſt tell you untowardly, and that of quantity nothing but a draught of the Mathema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, that of quality nothing but a draught of natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral and moral Philoſophy. Other things he brings in, which are not ſo as he makes, <hi>ubi</hi> to be a <hi>genus</hi> of <hi>intus</hi> and <hi>foras: ad aliquid</hi> comes under relates. <hi>Quando</hi> belongs to <hi>adjunctum, &amp;c.</hi> but becauſe Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicks uſe is there, they think they belong to Logick, by the ſame argument let them bring all Arts in Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick: but ſaith he, the things themſelves belong to the ſpecial Arts, but for the <hi>ſeries</hi> they belong to Logick, that is, as if he ſhould ſay, for their Logical notion they belong thither, but when he ſayes <hi>ſeries,</hi> he is preſently in method: for his <hi>ſeries</hi> is nothing but methods work; and if he reaſon that Arithme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick, Geometry, Nature, &amp;c. belong to Logick, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe methods uſe is there, that is <hi>fallacia accidentis,</hi> now the doctrine is one, and the uſe is another, the doctrine is diſtinct, the uſe confuſed: then again, whereas he ſayes here you have <hi>genus ſummum,</hi> and <hi>ſubalternum,</hi> why we heard of them in the diſtribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <hi>ex effectis:</hi> but becauſe <hi>ſubſtantia</hi> is <hi>corporea,</hi> or <hi>incorporea,</hi> here is a diſtribution as a <hi>genus</hi> into his <hi>ſpecies:</hi> therefore, ſaith he, this belongs to Logick: ſo let him bring in the daubers Art too; for Logicks uſe is there. Thus do they make a confuſion, not ſeeing things diſtinct. Again, whereas they help to find out a ſubject, and predicate, they have ſhut out ſome, namely <hi>incompleta,</hi> as a mans hand, which may be a ſubject or a predicate, and when I ſay the world is made of the firſt matter, is not the firſt matter here a predicate? ſo they ſhut out <hi>tranſcendentia,</hi> as <hi>ens:</hi> but is not <hi>homo ens,</hi> therefore a predicate? Again, is not a predicate an argument, <hi>ergo, artificiale, aut in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>artificiale?</hi>
                     <pb n="63" facs="tcp:115576:35"/> if <hi>artificiale,</hi> then fetched out of ſome Art, therefore let me carry my ſubject to the Art whereunto it belongs, and there will I find any pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate: again for the help of a <hi>medium,</hi> is every <hi>me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium</hi> a <hi>genus ſubalternum?</hi> Suppoſe we ſhall fetch a <hi>medium,</hi> that is <hi>genus ſummum,</hi> or an <hi>individuum,</hi> but let me go to the Art of my ſubject, and if I will take that which is above it, or below it, there I ſhall have it done to my hand. Again, he ſayes the doctrine of the predicaments ſerve for definitions, and differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, &amp;c. Why let me go to the Art, and there I ſhall ſee every thing taught to my hand, ſo that the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of predicaments <hi>quatenus</hi> they are adumbrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Arts, are to be ſeen in their Arts.

                  <p>We have heard what the end of Logick is, and all ſhoots at this mark, to reaſon well, that is, that we may handle our reaſon well; now that we may doe thus, we muſt have invention firſt, afterward judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Invention teacheth us to find out ſimples, Judgement teacheth us how to lay them together, we may compare invention or arguments, to the hook and nails in a thing; judgement to the faſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of them together. Now invention beholds argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. <hi>Argumentum</hi> in Logick is a concrete, as the Schools call it, ſignifying the thing, together with the affection that is in it to argue another thing: as a Taylor is a Taylor <hi>quatenus,</hi> he hath that affection in him to make a garment: ſo that invention intends immediately the affection, and mediately the thing: for <hi>ens quatenus ens,</hi> is general to <hi>ars quatenus ars,</hi> but <hi>ens quatenus</hi> it is affected <hi>ad arguendum,</hi> ſo it belongs to Logick alone, and thus we go by degrees; for the Lord doth not let us ſee any thing immediately: now the very name invention tels us what we muſt doe, namely, ſeek out, it tels us the Lord hath hid things ſecret in nature, and we muſt labour for the ſimples, and ſo find them: now we ſeek <hi>argumentum,</hi> which we heard to be of two ſorts, <hi>artificiale,</hi> or <hi>inartificia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le: artificiale</hi> is that which is in <hi>artificio rei;</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:115576:42"/> the <hi>inartificiale</hi> doth but cary to us what other men have ſeen by the <hi>artificials;</hi> and becauſe none can teſtifie of a thing before he have ſeen it himſelf, <hi>ergo, artificiale</hi> is before <hi>inartificiale:</hi> and alſo becauſe he that ſeeth <hi>inartificialiter,</hi> can but teſtifie ſo far forth as he ſees the thing, which is not at all, <hi>ergo,</hi> they that give teſtimony of that thing, whoſe artificial argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments they have not ſeen, are ſophiſters, and break this rule: and this is a ſophiſme of the Papiſts in their implicite faith, which do beleive as the Church be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leiveth, neither knowing the artificial arguments of the thing, nor the thing it ſelf that they beleive. Now the artificial arguments are in the <hi>artificio</hi> of the thing, <hi>ergo,</hi> we muſt of neceſſity know all the artifici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al arguments in things, if we will know the things themſelves wholly. And here by the way <hi>artificiale</hi> tels me, that every thing muſt be in ſome predicament, that is, in ſome Art, <hi>quod ex ſeſe arguit:</hi> this affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is in the thing, and it is <hi>ex ſe,</hi> drawn out of the thing as it were: ſo that this hook whereby it layes hold on another thing, is natural to it, for ſo he means. <hi>Artificiale eſt primo,</hi> or <hi>ſecundo in artificio rei,</hi> as if the thing had a ſecond kind of making, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, or being: ſo a thing is made of matter and form, <hi>primitus:</hi> but when we conſider how firſt ſingular parts are made of that matter, then organically are made of the ſingulars, and the whole made of the organical: here is the ſecond invention, and here the matter is conſidered immediately in the parts, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately in the whole. This is ſomething ſubtle, but yet evident and plain: as firſt, imagine that thing juſtice in a man; here is <hi>ſubjectum,</hi> and <hi>adjunctum:</hi> and this is the firſt invention: then from that quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in him, I can denominate him a juſt man, and this
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:115576:42"/> is the ſecond invention: ſo I look at a thing whoſe matter is made of wood, and can conjugate a name to it wooden: as a wooden cheſt, &amp;c. ſo when I ſay a man is made <hi>ab humo,</hi> here is the material cauſe, and effect: but at the ſecond hand, when I conſider how man is made <hi>ab humo,</hi> and from thence denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate him <hi>homo,</hi> there it is that ſecond Logick. So that the firſt invention onely looks at the thing, without conſideration of the names; the ſecond invention looks both at the thing, and at the names. So when I denominate <hi>homo</hi> from that thing juſtice in him, to be <hi>juſtus,</hi> I mean not the name; nor the thing, but the name and the thing together: for <hi>orta a primis per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inde ſunt ad id quod arguunt, ſicut prima unde oriuntur, ergo,</hi> there muſt be both the nature of the firſt argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in them, and that <hi>affectio</hi> alſo. So in a diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution, if we ſhall ſpeak of <hi>diſtributio ex effect is,</hi> as in <hi>navi, alii malos ſcandunt, alii per fores curſitant &amp;c.</hi> here <hi>malos ſcandere, per fores curſitare, ſentinam ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haurire,</hi> are cauſes and effects firſtly; but as theſe <hi>nautae</hi> are diſtributed by their effects, here is the <hi>orta categoria,</hi> the ariſing, arguing. So in a diſtribution <hi>ex cauſis</hi> of <hi>integrum</hi> into <hi>membra,</hi> the firſt invention is matter, and form, the ſecond invention is them two together in the members making up the <hi>integrum.</hi> So in a diſtribution of the <hi>genus</hi> into the <hi>ſpecies;</hi> as in <hi>animali,</hi> there is <hi>eſſentia corporea plena vitae, &amp; ſenſus,</hi> which are the cauſes of <hi>homo,</hi> and <hi>brutum:</hi> then there is a <hi>ſymbolum</hi> of them when we jumble them toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: ſo in a diſtribution <hi>ex adjunctis, homo</hi> is <hi>aeger, homo</hi> is <hi>ſanus,</hi> here is both <hi>ſubjectum,</hi> and <hi>adjunctum:</hi> but when I make a diſtribution, and ſay, <hi>homo eſt aeger, aut ſanus,</hi> this is the ſecond Logick: and this is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but the conſideration of the community of a
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:115576:43"/> cauſe, an effect, a ſubject, an adjunct, for that cauſeth theſe diſtributions: ſo in a definition there is firſtly <hi>genus,</hi> which ariſeth from matter and form; then the ſecond invention of them is the heaping of them together: ſo as they make but one argument, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>definitio:</hi> ſo in a diſtribution, though there may be more arguments, yet are they alſo heaped together to make one argument, namely, <hi>deſcriptio, quod eſt ſuae originis:</hi> this is true in reſpect of <hi>ortum,</hi> which made <hi>Ramus</hi> ſo define it: but I had rather reſpect the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finition of <hi>argumentum, quod ad aliquid arguendum affectum eſt,</hi> and to ſay <hi>artificiale ex ſe, primum pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitus:</hi> and ſo we ſhall deliver it as it acteth, which is beſt.</p>

                  <p> Now we come to <hi>materia,</hi> that (as we have heard) had a community with the efficient, which commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity was to move with it a great while before the form and end come: ſo ſoon as the efficient moves, preſently the matter moves, but the form and end move not a good while after. Now becauſe this dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference (which cauſeth the diſtribution of <hi>cauſa)</hi> appears in greater things, <hi>ergo</hi> it is alſo in leſs things: but our Logick tels us, that the efficient muſt go be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the matter, and how agreeable doth our Logick go to Gods work in the creatures? if we ſhall take a thing and reſolve it into his cauſes, and make them effects, and look at their cauſes, (for ſo when we look at their cauſes, we make them effects: ſo that abſurd is that definition of <hi>cauſa,</hi> to be either going before, or <hi>concomitans</hi> to the effect) at laſt we ſhall come to a firſt efficient that hath <hi>nihil prius</hi> to him, <hi>ergo</hi> he was not made, <hi>ergo</hi> he ever was, <hi>ergo</hi> all other things once were not, for they were made, <hi>ergo</hi> they now being were from the firſt, <hi>ergo</hi> the firſt matter was not eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> dreamed; but indeed he would croſs <hi>Plato</hi> in what he could; yet one may confute him by his own rules, for he grants there is a <hi>primus motor, ergo</hi> he is <hi>movens,</hi> but not moved, for then he ſhould have ſome thing to move him, and ſo not be firſt, <hi>ergo</hi> it is eaſie to make <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> beleive he is immoveable, becauſe he is firſt, <hi>ergo</hi> he muſt move others onely, for he is infinite, <hi>ergo</hi> without limits of place, <hi>ergo</hi> in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry place, <hi>ergo nuſquam incluſus,</hi> or <hi>excluſus, ergo</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moveable.</p>
                  <p>Now the firſt matter is firſt in his kind, namely, the firſt matter, but not the firſt thing: and we may conclude from this, that the firſt efficient was before the firſt matter: for if both were firſt, neither were

                  <p>For his name, as <hi>efficiens</hi> was <hi>extrafaciens,</hi> moving all the reſt, and not moved of them, but as it were <hi>pater;</hi> ſo <hi>materia</hi> is <hi>quaſi mater,</hi> out of which the thing ſprings, as out of a mother: ſo that we may ſee the name to be given <hi>a ſimili,</hi> but yet with very good reaſon; as the child is not <hi>a patre,</hi> but of the mother; ſo the effect is from the efficient, but ſprings out of the matter. Now that there is ſuch a matter thus it may appear; there is nothing compoſed, but its eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, and it ſelf a diſtinct; for to make <hi>eſſentia</hi> and <hi>ens</hi> to be the ſame, is peculiar to God. Again, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever is finite, that may be limited in his eſſence; now God onely is infinite, and every other thing fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite, <hi>ergo</hi> may be defined, <hi>ergo</hi> it ſelf and its eſſence are diſtinct, <hi>ergo</hi> it muſt have a matter. Again, if every thing have not eſſence, as they ſpeak of Angels, why are not they finite? <hi>ergo</hi> they may be defined, <hi>ergo</hi> their eſſence and themſelves are diſtinct: again, if they have not a matter, what have they? nothing but an efficient, and an end? then they ſhould be imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, and be either the firſt matter, or the firſt form: again, if they have a form, and no matter, then this form muſt be another thing from them, and how is that poſſible? for if the form and they be all one, then the cauſe and effect will be the ſame. But Logick is a general Art, and becauſe every thing hath a matter, <hi>ergo materia</hi> belongs hither, and the firſt matter had not a matter, for then it ſhould not have been firſt, but was <hi>incomplete.</hi>

                     <hi>Secundum ſequitur in forma, &amp; fine:</hi> he doth not ſay, <hi>Secundus eſt forma &amp; fine:</hi> now as the efficient and matter were combined together, as moving to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether a while without the form and end: ſo the form and end, though the form be before, yet the end comes preſently after, and is as it were the <hi>pediſſequa</hi> to the form: and indeed where we cannot find the form of a thing, we put the end, as being next to it, and beſt expreſſing it. So <hi>bene diſſerere,</hi> the end of Logick, is put for the form of Logick; now as this diſtinction of the motion of the cauſes is ſeen in grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter matters, ſo is it alſo in leſs: for there is a co-ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the efficient and end together firſt, then of the form, and end together alſo, though not without the efficient and matter. In <hi>forma &amp; fine,</hi> for the form is before the final cauſe; for before the form be induced, or ingenerated in the matter, it cannot be good for his end, and the end is <hi>cauſa</hi> in reſpect of the effect, not of the efficient. So we ſay a coat hath a form before it have an end, for it may be a coat, and yet not fit to ſerve me: now then as the efficient be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan the motion, and the motion redounded out of the matter, ſo it runs <hi>per formam, &amp; finem.</hi>

The efficient, and matter we ſee what they are, the cheſtity, or tability, or theſe do deliver the form as well as they can, but the end deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers it better, The way to know this is onely by the other rules of Logick, every member (as we heard before) contains a portion of the matter, and the form of the whole; how can that be? it is true, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>membrum</hi> is eſſential to the whole. Indeed the doctrine of <hi>forma</hi> hath troubled the Schools very
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:115576:61"/> much, and how to name it I cannot tell, onely it is <hi>cauſa per quam res eſt,</hi> this it is. The firſt efficient in time made the firſt matter, then he did <hi>ſuperſtruere</hi> a form upon it, ſo that the matter is the foundation of the form, whereby it is retained. Now in the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments both the matter and form are uniform, and therefore their parts are ſingular not making a mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but taking hold one of another, for ſo the matter is <hi>principium paſſionis,</hi> and the form <hi>actionis,</hi> and then again they both conſpire to make up the whole. The next things are mingled of the elements, where all the elements are in every part; by this means there is a matter made of the matter of the four elements, and a form made of the forms of the four elements, and this is the beſt way to ſee the forms of any thing: a mans arm contains a portion of the matter and form of the whole: and again, it is made of ſingular parts which ſtill contain a portion both of the matter, and of the form of it: ſo that in the end the forms of things ariſe from the elements by miſtion; and this is that which <hi>Galen</hi> and <hi>Hippocrates</hi> mean when they call <hi>forma craſis:</hi> ſo for artificial things their forms ariſe from the forms of their parts: ſo that to know the forms of things this is the right, <hi>forma eſt cauſa per quam, &amp;c.</hi> Now if we take this courſe to ſee the forms of things we ſhall eaſily ſee the truth: look how many members there are in a body, ſo many por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of matter and form there are, <hi>ergo, vita vegita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiva,</hi> and <hi>ſenſitiva,</hi> are not the forms, but that is it that ariſeth from the union of the elements forms: now by this means neither do we teach that the forms of things periſh, and are annihilated, as the Philoſophers ſay, neither are their forms divers, but conſpire toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to make one; neither is life a form, ſo that a

                  <p>We have made an entrance into the formal cauſe, and have heard how that it is after the efficient, and the matter: again whereas every cauſe gave an <hi>eſſe,</hi> the form did that, and more too, the efficient gave a bare being, the matter gave a being and part of his eſſence, and the form gives his whole eſſence, and make it that which it is, and that reaſon of that makes it differ from all other things, and this the common Logicians did conſider, when they made <hi>differentia</hi> to be <hi>diviſiva,</hi> or <hi>conſtitutiva.</hi> Now here was their miſtaking, that they called it <hi>differentia,</hi> which doth not ariſe from the eſſence of it, but from this proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that <hi>forma ſimul cum reipſo ingeneratur.</hi>

                  <p>Now whilſt he ſaith <hi>ſimul</hi> at once, it may ſeem by this that the form and effect are together; he means not together in nature, for the form muſt be before the effect, becauſe it conſtitutes the effect, and the conſtituter is before the thing conſtituted, therefore how are they <hi>ſimul?</hi> he means <hi>forma ſimul ingene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat:</hi> thus, I ſuppoſe two go together, and yet one of them goeth before the other, here is a priority, and <hi>ſimul</hi> too, he that is before goeth firſt, the other fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth, yet both move together: and as two hands laid together do move together, and yet one before the other, ſo is it with the formal cauſe and effect, the formal cauſe moves, and the effect alſo, but the effect follows it in every ſtep, and the final cauſe follows the form, as the ſhadow follows the body, and the effect comes laſt: again, this is a property, <hi>ergo,</hi> an adjunct, <hi>ergo,</hi> is after the ſubject, for the form is an ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect before it be a ſubject: ſo that the efficient doth as it were make the form, and the effect ſtill follows as we may ſee in artificial things, ſo that ſo far forth as the form is ingenerated, ſo farre forth the effect is accompliſhed.</p>

<pb n="118" facs="tcp:115576:64"/> there can be no form without a matter, therefore this example will not ſerve his turn, yet he brings that he could get; many in Schools have ſtumbled at this, and have gone about to mend it, but indeed they have marred it.</p>
                  <p>Some ſay <hi>ratio</hi> belongs to Angels, <hi>ergo,</hi> it is not the proper form of <hi>homo,</hi> and therefore they have added <hi>mortale,</hi> and ſay <hi>homo</hi> is <hi>animal rationale mortale.</hi> Now if they joyn <hi>mortale</hi> to <hi>ratio,</hi> it is not <hi>mortalis.</hi> Again, <hi>animal ratione mortale</hi> doth detract from man, unleſs we ſpeak of his body.</p>

In what figure were Angels firſt created? An. In what figure was water firſt made? they can take any figure as water can; but I think they were firſt made in the figure of roundneſs. So <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſaith they were made as <hi>puncta.</hi> So is fire round, for that is <hi>figura capaciſſima, ergo, perfectiſſima.</hi> I have thought alſo that the Ark was made for all the world like a man, and there was the proportion of length proportionable to a mans breadth, and the heighth proportionable to a mans thickneſs. Now for the wanting of parts it is not ſo; for Angels may be divided, though their parts be ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mular: ſo are the elements parts; and as ſome write, the wicked ſpirits may be ſtruck, and ſo the Sun light; but it will too quickly return into it ſelf: and as the light may be divided, ſo may they. And whereas they ſay, <hi>anima</hi> is <hi>tota in toto,</hi> and <hi>tota in qualibet par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te,</hi> they wrong God, and the creature, for what is the

There is a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>continuance, and the ſame thing ſhould be here, and not there, which is flat contradiction: but God is not in this or that finger, but alſo between them. The Papiſts abſurdity appears notably in this, in that they will have Chriſts body to be really in the Sacrament in the bread, and in heaven alſo, and yet not in the air, but make a diſcontinuance: <hi>ergo</hi> it is in the bread, and not in the bread; in heaven, and not in heaven; for if it is in heaven, there it is ſhut up, and ſo in the bread.</p>

Now here he ſhews that the adjunct is that that is builded upon the ſubject: and as the ſubject did preſuppoſe a thing already made, but muſt ſupport another thing;
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:115576:75"/> ſo <hi>adjunctum</hi> tels me it is a thing already made, but muſt lye upon the ſubject: <hi>ſubjectum</hi> ſignifies a ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porter, or a ſuppoſitory as it were: <hi>adjunctum,</hi> that is more common than <hi>ſubjectum,</hi> and <hi>ſubjectum</hi> lyes alway under; but <hi>adjunctum</hi> it may either lye over, or under, or be tacked to either ſide, yet it will fall off, unleſs it be nailed, or adjoyned to the ſubject.

Time may well be compared to a line; and as <hi>fluxus punctum</hi> is <hi>linea,</hi> ſo <hi>fluxus nunc</hi> is <hi>tempus:</hi> he went in the turning of a hand, that is, whileſt one might have turned his hand: ſo that I meaſure it by the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,

Much deſcanting there is about time among other Logicians, which teach that it hath a double reſpect, one to the thing meaſured, and ſo it is properly time, another to the thing meaſuring, and that is not time, but as one is meaſuring it: now for the logical notion of time it is all one whether it be active or paſſive, and it is one and the ſame thing diverſly reſpected, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe active and paſſive go alwayes together, <hi>ergo,</hi> the time muſt needs be general to both; <hi>praeterita, praeſens</hi> and <hi>futura.</hi> So for things that are ſubject to our Logick are divided into paſt, preſent and to come, for onely God is not ſubject to time, becauſe he is eternal, <hi>ergo</hi> is <hi>omne non eſſe ante poſt,</hi> neither can we ſay be is now if we reſpect time, for what ſhould meaſure him, ſhould <hi>primum mobile,</hi> or day and night? no, ſo that though he be at all times according to our Logick, yet he is with out reſpect of time at all times, for time is not eternal, <hi>ergo</hi> not <hi>omne non eſſe ante poſt.</hi> And Grammar, which is the garment of Logick, doth ſpeak by the verb of time paſt, preſent, and to come; now we give it in Grammar to verbs, not but that it may be given to every thing, as well as to actions, and paſſions, but that we deliver it actively or paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively.</p>
                  <p>Again, <hi>primum mobile</hi> which God hath made a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon globe to all the world, and is meaſured accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to <hi>praeterita, praeſens,</hi> and <hi>futura, ergo,</hi> time is in

                  <p>VVE have heard how things may be compared with things, and this compariſon was either in quantity or quality, which quantity was a logical quantity, not a geometrical quantity, for it was of things where Geometry cannot be conſidered.

Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria</hi> were pairs, matches and equals, and <hi>imparia</hi> are ſuch as agree not in any one of theſe three: but the <hi>aliquid</hi> here as it is greater to one, ſo is it leſs to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. <hi>Imparia</hi> therefore are ſuch as are not pairs, but the one is greater than the other.</p>

                  <p>COncerning this doctrine of <hi>diſtributio,</hi> we have heard the generalitie: the ground from whence a diſtribution doth ariſe, is, for that the firſt argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are common: as a common cauſe may be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtributed by the effects, in like ſort a common effect may be diſtributed into ſpeciall cauſes: and ſo for the ſubject and adjunct: ſo that beſide that commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, there is nothing new in this ſecond invention. In a diſtribution we obſerved a whole and a part: the whole contains the parts, and the parts are contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned of the whole, <hi>ergo,</hi> if either the whole contain not all the parts, or all the parts be not contained of the whole, there will be no diſtribution. Now theſe arguments did ariſe from conſentanies, in reſpect of the whole, but from diſſentanies <hi>inter ſe. Itaque tanto accuratior erit, &amp;c. ergo,</hi> a diſtribution into a dicotomy, which is of contraries is the beſt; yet if it cannot be had, we muſt be fain to make a trico<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomy. Now we come to the <hi>ſpecies</hi> of Diſtribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>

                  <p>A diſtribution is a derivative argument from cauſe, or from <hi>modo quodam conſentaneorum ut ſubjectorum, et adjunctorum.</hi> Now the uſe of diſtribution is this, that we may range every thing in his own order and
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:115576:107"/> place, for when we have ſeen a thing in his <hi>eſſe,</hi> and <hi>bene eſſe,</hi> and then that it is not this or that; and have alſo compared it with other things, to ſee whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be equall or unequall, like or unlike, and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe have given it a name; in the next place it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite, that we ſet it in his rank, for ſo the Lord hath ranged every thing in the world, as man under his <hi>genus animal,</hi> for the Lord hath made all things liable to our Logick, <hi>ergo,</hi> they muſt be ranged under ſome head, that we may ſee how they agree, and how they diſagree.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Diſtributio</hi> is double (as I ſaid before) <hi>ex abſolute conſentaneis, et modo quodam conſentaneis:</hi> ſo that he calls that diſtribution which ariſeth from a generall cauſe, and a generall effect. <hi>Diſtributio prima:</hi> It is <hi>prima</hi> in a double reſpect; firſt, becauſe <hi>cauſa</hi> and <hi>effectum</hi> are <hi>prima:</hi> ſecondly, as they are before <hi>ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectum</hi> and <hi>adjunctum.</hi> He takes <hi>diſtributio</hi> here in the active ſignification, and according thereunto muſt the <hi>ſpecies</hi> be proſecuted, for he doth define them from the parts dividing. For the notation of the word (which gives great light) it comes of <hi>tribuo</hi> and <hi>dis,</hi> as if it ſignified that diſtribution that juſtice gives: it is a term belonging to Law, as many of our Logicall terms doe: and here it ſignifieth a ſevering of the parts, and a giving to every part his due, as when a common cauſe is diſtributed, and then to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſpeciall effect his own cauſe is given: ſo that here is nothing in this new invention, but this diſtributi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the reſt is the firſt invention: as when I ſay, a man is ſick, and a man is well, here are two ſubjects, and two adjuncts: but when I ſay of men, ſome are ſick and ſome are well, here is a diſtribution. Now the
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:115576:108"/> reaſon why he joyneth both <hi>cauſa</hi> and <hi>effectum</hi> toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſaying, <hi>ex abſolute conſentaneis, cauſis nempe, &amp; effectis,</hi> is becauſe that in a diſtribution as there are parts, ſo there is a whole; <hi>diſtributio</hi> being both active and paſſive, though it be principally denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated from the parts: ſo that where the cauſe is the whole, there the effects muſt be parts.</p>

                  <p>So that here the effect is the whole, and the cauſes are the parts: now he proſecutes the doctrine of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtribution by the parts, becauſe he goes according to the act of things, and the parts here conſtitute the whole: again, a whole, the very name doth deny a diſtribution; for if it be whole it is not diſtributed: but the parts ſhew a whole, <hi>ergo,</hi> we muſt apply di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtribution to the parts; hence <hi>diſtributio ex cauſis</hi> is not when the cauſe is a whole, but when the cauſes are parts.

                  <p>VVE have heard of artificiall arguments, and there can be nothing that ſhall be in the <hi>artificio</hi> of any thing, but we have heard it: ſo that if we look at any of the creatures of God to ſee the root, the cauſes of it, and then the whole circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference and limitation thereof, we may by theſe ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments taught before, ſee it throughly. Now where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as one man cannot ſee all things, though at the firſt all things were made for one man, the Lord hath in wiſdom ordained that we ſhould receive ſomethings by reports from others; for as the world was to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe both in men and other creatures, it was impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible that one man ſhould ſee all things <hi>intus &amp; in<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cute:</hi> ſo that whereas at the beginning all things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing made for one man, and he afterwards could not ſee them, yet ſtill it is ſo far forth true whileſt all men ſee all things. It is called <hi>inartificiale</hi> for the contrary reaſon that <hi>artificiale</hi> was ſo called, namely of being in the thing, whereas this is not in the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the thing, but <hi>externè</hi> altogether: ſo that we may ſee his force by this, having no farther to doe with the thing, then onely by witneſſing of it.</p>

                  <p>This tranſition contains the concluſion of all that went before, and the propoſition of that which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows: and here again we may ſee how artificiall ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments go before inartificials, becauſe inartifici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all arguments have no ground but as they are backt with artificials. And this doctrine we may ſee to be true by the practiſe of common people; for if a man give teſtimony of that he knowes not, others will ſay he doth he knowes not what: For as no man can give teſtimony of that he knowes not; ſo no man ought to receive a teſtimony, but as it is backt with artificials, otherwiſe he knowes not the thing ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently as he ſhould; and if he firſt hear a teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of a thing, and afterward come to ſee the thing, he will then ſay he knowes it, not becauſe one teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied ſo much, but becauſe himſelf ſaw it to be ſo. It is called <hi>Argumentum inartificiale,</hi> becauſe it never comes into Art to make up a Rule, though it may come in as a commoration to prove a rule ſyllogiſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally; but method is the diſpoſition of axioms, not of ſyllogiſmes: now a teſtimony of a thing belongs to that Art to which the thing witneſſed doth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long: as <hi>Ariſtotles</hi> authority againſt the creation of the world belongs to Divinity, there to be confuted in the doctrine of the creation.</p>

The glue which we heard of before, was that affection of one argument to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, which the common Logicians call <hi>categoria:</hi> but when they are put together in diſpoſition, they belong to judgement: ſo that here we ſhall hear of nothing but laying of ſimples together, that is, of arguments with arguments; and that is either of two ſides, of one argument to one, as in a ſimple axiom: or of
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:115576:129"/> three ſides together, as in a ſyllogiſme: or laſtly of axioms one after another for the help of memory, which is method: ſo that when we have ſeen this, we may ſee the reach of our reaſon, and the rule of it.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Judicium</hi> is properly the act of our underſtanding, as it doth diſcern and determine truth and falſhood: for it comes of <hi>judex</hi> a judge: and when an axiom is made, our judgement comes to judge it: ſo that the name will in the end hardly be found large enough for this part of Logick. I would rather diſtribute it thus, <hi>Dialecticae partes duae ſunt, Inventio, &amp; Diſpoſitio,</hi> and then <hi>Diſpoſitio est judicium, aut methodus:</hi> and <hi>judicium est axiomaticum, aut ſyllogisticum.</hi> My rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons are theſe, firſt becauſe in method I ſee no more judgement than in invention, but it is properly of the order of axioms. Again, judgement is for truth, and falſhood, and that is the drift of axiomatical and
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:115576:129"/> ſyllogiſtical judgement, <hi>ergo,</hi> they two are to be cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled together. Again, I obſerve this in nature, that there are three internal ſenſes, fancie, cogitation and memory, for the common ſenſe is all one with fancie. Now theſe ſerve reaſon, as the two affections love and hatred ſerve will; for as there is the affection of love to embrace that which will willeth, and the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of hatred to hate that which will nilleth: ſo there is to ſerve reaſon, firſt a fancy that ſerves inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; cogitation and memory that ſerve diſpoſition. Now theſe three are diſtinct in nature, becauſe their organs and inſtruments by which they work are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct, for the organ or inſtrument of fancy is heat, the inſtrument of cogitation is drith, and moiſture of memory. Now the oppoſite to heat is cold, therefore cogitation and memory communicate in cold: then cold is a dry or moiſt cold, the dry cold is the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of cogitation, the moiſt cold is the organ of memory, but this cold muſt be but in a degree, for if it be too cold all is mard. Now then cogitation and memory communicating together in cold, there muſt be a <hi>genus,</hi> wherein judgement and method muſt alſo communicate, and that is <hi>diſpoſitio:</hi> ſo that as theſe organs are by nature ſevered in man, ſo nature muſt ſever our reaſon into invention and diſpoſition, and diſpoſition into <hi>judicium</hi> and <hi>methodus:</hi> and that theſe are diſtinct in nature many reaſons do ſhew, for when a man is firſt born, then is his invention beſt, his judgement is beſt when he is paſt <hi>juvenis,</hi> he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>members beſt when he is a child, and then beſt for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention, becauſe his head is then hotteſt; afterward beſt for judgement, becauſe then his brain is dryeſt: firſt of all beſt for memory, becauſe his head then is moyſteſt: again, man in the morning remembers beſt,
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:115576:130"/> becauſe then his brain is moyſt by reaſon of the fumes that aſcend to the brain, when he ſleepeth; at noon he is fitteſt for cogitation, becauſe his brain is then dryeſt; at night he invents beſt, becauſe then his brain is cold: and as in the Su<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

The reaſon is this indeed, if a child ſhould have uſe of his diſpoſition firſt, it would hinder his growth, for a child hath leaſt uſe of his reaſonable ſoul for a long time, becauſe it is an hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drance of the acts of the vegetative and ſenſitive ſoul, by reaſon hereof if he ſhould be moyſteſt, he could not grow to that ſtature which is fitting: or if he ſhould be dry, it would not extend his moyſture again afterward; that his fancie is moyſteſt, it is for the <hi>bene eſſe</hi> of the body, for moiſture is moſt praedo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minant in him, till he come to the <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>: we have heard the reaſon of the name, that it is a brief of that which is more largely delivered: now for this cauſe the Stoicks called it a fiſt, for it is not generally of Logick, but belongs to a ſyllogiſm.

<pb n="307" facs="tcp:115576:159"/> ſimple diſpoſition, but of the conſequent part of the queſtion in the propoſition, of the antecedent in the aſſumption, <hi>ergo,</hi> from the breaking of this queſtion thus, as there is a ſimple diſpoſition, it is called ſimple, but in a compoſite ſyllogiſm the whole queſtion, and the third argument are diſpoſed together, <hi>ergo,</hi> accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to theſe two kinds of diſpoſition there are theſe parts of a ſyllogiſm; now the reaſon why there is this diſpoſition in nature is this, the third argument which is well called ſo here, becauſe here the parts of the queſtion are broken, the truth muſt either be ſuch, as is ſo doubtful, as we muſt be fain to pull the parts of the queſtion in ſunder to ſee it, and then we make a ſimple ſyllogiſm: or if the queſtion be not ſo doubtful but that we may ſoon perceive it, then we make but a compoſite ſyllogiſm: hence it is, that the common Logicians never dreamed of a compoſite ſyllogiſm, but onely of a ſimple, deſiring to make all things more clear, but there are often more fallaces lie lurking under a compoſite ſyllogiſm, then under a ſimple one: hence in Schools we ſay, diſpute <hi>ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagorice,</hi> for in a compoſite the third argument be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing diſpoſed with the whole queſtion, doth not ſo clear it, as in a ſimple it doth; yet none is to except againſt it, the compoſite ſyllogiſm clears the whole queſtion, the ſimple clears both the parts of the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion.</p>

<pb n="335" facs="tcp:115576:173"/> arguments for the proof of any thing, and may ſo keep them: as for example: <hi>otioſus eſt amator, Egi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtus eſt otioſus, ergo Egiſtus eſt amator.</hi> The propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition belongs to moral Philoſophy, for <hi>vitium</hi> is a vice, love is concupiſcence the ſin, and it is the affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of love diſordered, <hi>ergo,</hi> this breaks the ſeventh Commandement, <hi>ergo,</hi> this axiom belongs hither, for love is the more ſpecial. <hi>Egiſtus eſt otioſus:</hi> this indeed belongs to the hiſtory of <hi>Egiſtus:</hi> but becauſe we have it not, therefore we may carry it to <hi>otium:</hi> ſo the concluſion belongs to moral Philoſophy, to concupiſcence. Again, ſyllogiſms ſerve but for the clearing of the truth of axioms, and then afterward we return again to the rule of an axiom to judge whether it be true or falſe, and this is all that is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for diſpoſing arguments, <hi>ergo,</hi> method is <hi>diſpoſitio axiomatum</hi> onely.

                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> But we remember words.</p>

The reaſon why we remember a man whom we have ſeen before, is becauſe we remember the diſpoſition of the parts of his body, noſe, mouth, eyes, &amp;c. and ſo turning the glaſs of our underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unto him again, we know him; and if we would remember any thing for our own preſent uſe, let us
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:115576:175"/> carry them home to their places, and we ſhall not forget them: and here we may ſee that we do not remember by taking the <hi>ſpecies</hi> of things into our brain, and there lay them up as in a cheſt, or let them hang as birds in a lime twig, and are received by fancy firſt, as if it did faſhion them, then cogitation conſiders of them, and memory keeps them.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>His we are to know, That God made all things for man, and at the beginning for one man, for there was but one: but ſince the Fall, becauſe all things cannot come under one man's eye, immediately, therefore God hath provid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Speech, to be an <hi>Hobſon,</hi> or Carrier, between man and man; that thereby he might ſee all things, and that ſo Gods Ordinance, of making all things for one man, might ſtill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue. Logick doth act and bring the thing to my underſtanding &amp; afterwards Speech is the carrier of
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:115576:182"/> it, therfore, it is neceſſary that there ſhould be a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant rule of ſpeech, that one man might underſtand another; but whereas theſe things, being uttered by Speech, are therefore hard to be received, becauſe they are inartificial Arguments: therefore God hath provided Two arts of Speech, one of propriety of Speech, and another of the decking and ſweetning of it. So that the Lord doth here, even as Phyſitians uſe to do with their Patients, to wit, when they have a bitter Potion to give, they uſe to ſugar the top of the Pot wherein it is. So that Grammer may be compared to a plain Garment wtithout welt or gard, or it is like a grave Citizen. Rhetorick may be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to the lace, or jags on the garment, and is like a fine Courtier: Poetry may be compared to ſome fine cut, and is a Courtier—going on his feet: ſo that according to the double uſe of Speech it is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided into two parts: the firſt wherof is Grammer.</p>
            <p>The name <hi>Grammatica</hi> is a Greek word, which therefore we ſee was firſt named of the <hi>Grecians,</hi> and is derived of <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> a letter, of <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> a line of <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> which ſignifieth, (1) to engrave <hi>ſeu inſculpo,</hi> and hence cometh our Engliſh word, ingrave: (2) <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> ſignifieth to write, becauſe, the firſt writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing was by Hieroglyphicks, for at the firſt they uſed Hieroglyphicks, making the images of Birds or Beaſts, as an Horſe for ſwiftneſs, a Bear or Lion for ſtrength: a Lions head and a Ring in it they uſe ſtill over mens doors, ſignifying thereby watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs. For in Philoſophy, we find that a Lion ſleepeth with open eyes, and this was the firſt kind of writing: The ſecond was in wax Tables, or Tables laid over with wax, where they have a ſtile made of ſteele, (and our Engliſh word ſteel cometh of <hi>ſtilus)</hi>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:115576:182"/> and hence alſo <hi>ſtilus</hi> ſignifieth a pen; Now they wrote in theſe, by lifting up the wax, and ſo was the letter made: hence came <hi>exarare</hi> to ſignifie to write, <hi>i e.</hi> to plow up, as they did the wax, and ſo ſhut up the Tables; and theſe, as <hi>Tully</hi> ſpeaketh, had every one his letter-carrier to his Friend, and hence came let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-carriers, or <hi>tabellarii,</hi> and the Friend had keyes to open the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ables, and ſo read the letters: The next kind of writing was in the rind of the bark of a Beech, and there thy wrote with ink, and rolled them up. Now this rind was like unto parchment, and thence came <hi>liber,</hi> (which is properly that rind) to ſignifie a Book; and our Engliſh word Book co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth of that word Beech, Buck, and to this day moſt of that which we call Beech, is called Buckmaſt. Now concerning the invention of ink, which was here firſt uſed, we read not of it; only this, that ſome call it <hi>atramentum ſutorium,</hi> and therefore it ſeems they learned to make it by Coblers and Dyers. The next kind of writing was in Parchment made of Sheep skins and Goat skins, which was invented in Phrygia, at Pergamus in Troy, and thence came <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gamena,</hi> to ſignifie Parchment. The laſt kind of writing was in Papyr, which was firſt invented in Egypt which was made of a ruſh, called <hi>Papyros,</hi> hence came it to be named <hi>Papyrus,</hi> and Papyr in Engliſh: hence is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> of <hi>biblos</hi> that ruſh.</p>
            <p>Printing was invented a great while after any of theſe, not paſt ſome 300 years ago; it was invented at <hi>Gaud</hi> in <hi>Picardy,</hi> where there was a Knight that had his Seal fell into his ink as he was writing a let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and he taking it up ſomething nimbly for foiling his fingers let it fall in again, and afterwards lying on the papyr, there it left the print of the letters, and
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:115576:183"/> he ſeeing that, did by that means invent Printing: and thus much for <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. From that cometh <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> a line, and before <hi>Moſes</hi> we know there was no wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting but only by Hierogliphicks, ſo that lines are not ſo ancient as hieroglyphicks, except we mean ſuch lines as we write from one ſide of the papyr to the other: Now for writing by letters, <hi>Moſes</hi> was the firſt, or rather God, as we may well think, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he hath brought all ſounds to ſo few letters; though <hi>Joſephus</hi> makes mention of two pillars that were before <hi>Moſes,</hi> wherein were written the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of the Mathematicks, and that he ſaw one of them, yet I think he was either deceived, or they were after <hi>Moſes,</hi> and <hi>hactenus</hi> of <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>.</p>
            <p>Now followeth <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>litera,</hi> for every letter hath lines except one, which hath only one, and that is (jod) which ſignifieth a ſpace becauſe it leaves out a ſpace: And hence is <hi>Grammatica</hi> a Greek word, underſtand <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, and it will be a literal art, or the art of letters, becauſe their language which they were to learn being natural unto them, they needed not to go any further than to learn their letters and to ſpell them, ſo they called it <hi>Grammatica literaria:</hi> as if the whole art of Grammer conſiſted only in the knowledge of letters. So that this name is as much too ſtrait for the thing, as a Childs ſhoo is for <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cules</hi> foot; but yet we knowing the meaning of the name, may ſtill keep it, knowing that was the errour of them which gave it, not of thoſe who ſhall after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards hold it. <hi>Grammatica</hi> is too ſtrait, for the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters are the leaſt part of Etymologie; and truly, if we look at the names of all Arts, we ſhall find that they were named before they were perfected, as <hi>Dialectiea, coloquor:</hi> an adjunct. <hi>Rhetorica,</hi> a fluent Speech,</p>
            <pb n="5" facs="tcp:115576:183"/>
            <p> Now this Art of <hi>Grammer</hi> is but one in nature, for at the beginning there was but one Speech, (as but one man) till an hundred years after the floud. Again, Speech is but one, in regard of the faculty, and alſo in regard of man; ſo that all the languages in the world are but as ſo many idioms of the ſame Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, and not divers Grammers; for one definition of Grammer, and one diſtribution; one definition of <hi>vox,</hi> and one diſtribution of <hi>vox, numeri &amp; ſive numero</hi> ſerveth to them all: And as in Greek thoſe ſeveral Dialects do not mak ſeveral Grammers, but only divers idioms; ſo do all languages whatſoever make ſeveral idioms, not ſeveral Grammers. Now this variety of languages came by the building of <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel,</hi> for whereas they built a Tower, both that might be famous for memory, and underſtanding that God would deſtroy the World either by Fire, or Water, therefore thus in their fooliſh conceits, they went a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to prevent the power of God; firſt laying brick, and uſing ſlime for morter to prevent fire, and a—of Reed and Palm-tree leaves, which are very broad and like a target, which are there to be ſeen until this day, that they might ſwim upon the—made of this Reed: And <hi>Herodotus</hi> wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth that there were eight Aſcents in it, and the two lowermoſt were Furlonges high, ſo that if the reſt were ſo, it was a mile high; and on the top (he ſaith) there was a Temple built, which was dedicated to <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piter Belus,</hi> Son of <hi>Nimrod:</hi> This Tower they built, being loth to diſperſe themſelves abroad over the face of the earth, as they were commanded <hi>Geneſis</hi> the firſt, to repleniſh the earth: therefore it pleaſed God to work that Confuſion of Tongues among them to ſever them, and ſo make diverſity of Countries; for
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:115576:184"/> according to their Tongues commonly Countries are ſevered. Of theſe Tongues were firſt the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Tongue, then the deducts from it; the mother Tongue is Hebrew, firſt, in reſpect of its ſelf, for it is moſt natural, for there is not any natural notion, but it hath its natural word. Again, in Hebrew are the feweſt words and yet ſignifie the moſt things. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, it is plain by the Scriptures, for the Hiſtory, in <hi>Geneſis</hi> ſheweth, that the words are Hebrew words, as <hi>Adam HEvah:</hi> But <hi>objection,</hi> Why might not God have given them from the <hi>Du<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ch's?</hi> No, for there is no <hi>Dutch</hi> name ſo effectual as the Hebrew names be; ſo the Lord called the Heavens <hi>Shammajim,</hi> and there is no name in the world that ſignifieth ſo; and the Sea <hi>Jam,</hi> there is no tongue that doth term it ſo from the ſame reaſon, and until the building of <hi>Babylon,</hi> their names were Hebrew names, and the Towns which they built before <hi>Babylon,</hi> had alſo Hebrew names; therefore, that Speech was the firſt.</p>
            <p>We have heard the reaſon of this name <hi>Grammati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca,</hi> which is the <hi>definitum,</hi> now followeth the <hi>defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of it: i. e. <hi>Ars generalis in ſermone,</hi> and ſo Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer is <hi>Ars benè loquendi.</hi> Firſt, he calleth it <hi>Ars,</hi> for that which is, and is for an end, muſt have a conſtant rule to guide man to that end. From this <hi>genus</hi> many queſtions may ariſe; as, How can Speech be eternal, ſeeing it is proper to man? Here we are to know that Speech is a Creature of God, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore 'twas in his eternal decree, as all other things: and though it be true that there was but one Tongue from the beginning of the World till the deſtruction of <hi>Babel,</hi> yet in Gods decree all the reſt are eternal, and ſo is the rule of Speech, and they were in the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal notion of God. Again, their words do vary
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:115576:184"/> continually, therefore they were not eternal; for if one that died 500 years ago were now alive, and ſhould ſpeak, we could not underſtand him. <hi>Anſw.</hi> Though it be true that words by reaſon of many ſounds do daily change, yet the rule is eternal; though they be not ſpoken from eternal, yet the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of Speech doth not change the rule of Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer. as in reaſon, this axiome <hi>homo eſt animal</hi> was true before <hi>homo</hi> was, and will be for ever: So in Grammer is the rule eternal, as likewiſe is the rule of generation and corruption eternal, and ever true and the ſame, though men daily be generated and corrupted; ſo is Grammers rule external, though, &amp;c. and 'tis becauſe God would ſhew his mighty power and wiſdom, that there are as many ſeveral Grammers, as there are ſeveral ages, and more too; and there is nothing more wonderful under heaven then to conſider the great variety o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>This general art of Speech is twofold, both Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer and Rhetorick; but the difference is this, that Grammer carrieth the matter in a budget neither too big nor too little, like one of theſe Iriſhmen with Breeches without pockets. <hi>Rhetorica</hi> carrieth it in a fine bag full of laces, yet not altogether full, for there are more words then matter; therefore both Grammer, Rhetorick, and Poetry are all e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually general for ſubject, but not for uſe. For Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers uſe is before the uſe of them, and may be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out them even as a garment may be without a lace or jag. But here by the way, becauſe theſe are general Arts, therefore they have no proper ſubject, but their uſe may be everywhere, and therefore <hi>Kecker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi> whilſt he maketh Rhetorick a ſpecial art, telleth me he never knew the right diſtribution of the arts,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:115576:185"/> for it is the art of Speech, and that may be every<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, therefore Rhetorick is general and may be uſed in any thing; therefore Tropes upon due conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration may be uſed in any art. Now if it be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, whether it be better to uſe Grammer, or Rhetorick in teaching of Children? I <hi>Anſw.</hi> Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer is better, 1. Becauſe it is more general than Rhetorick: 2. Becauſe it keeps us more cloſe to the matter, which is a very good thing in teaching; yet not withſtanding ſometime Rhetorick is better, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it delivers the proper word together with ſome ſweetneſs, for Tropes do ariſe from ſome arguments in Logick; ſo that we cannot condemne Rhetorick, neither is it poſſible we ſhould alwayes uſe Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, ſeeing there be many more things then proper names; for God making all things, and Man being to name them, and had not names ſufficient for them: therefore for want of words, gave the ſame name to divers things by Tropes; and therefore <hi>Talaeus</hi> ſaith <hi>neceſſitas tropum genuit:</hi> Yet at the beginning one thing had but one name, but afterwards the ſame word came to ſignifie many things, as we ſee in He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew, where one word ſignifieth twenty things, and but one properly and Grammatically, and all the reſt Tropically. And I find that words are uſed impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly theſe wayes: Firſt, in reſpect of the Trope: Secondly, when we deliver the ſame things, in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers languages, there they uſe divers phraſes, which muſt be compared together, as <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> is good in Greek, in Latin it is to <hi>make Children,</hi> which is not uſual. Now if you will know whether is better, bring them to Logick, and there ſee which phraſe is more ſpecial, that is to be prefer'd: to <hi>make</hi> it ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral to the efficient cauſe in general, to <hi>beget</hi> or

               <p>Is here an adverb joyned to the verb to ſhew his ſignification, and is not another word from <hi>loqui,</hi> and the reaſon of it is this, a man may <hi>loqui,</hi> but not <hi>bene loqui,</hi> as <hi>bonus vinum</hi> was as good as their Wine, but not good Grammer; as a man may diſpute ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phiſtically or ignorantly, and ſo break the rule of Logick: ſo likewiſe he may <hi>malè loqui</hi> and break the rule of Grammer.

And again, howſoever it may be objected that Grammer is not in every thing (for many things have no names) and ſo is not a general Art, yet the work of Grammer is in every thing: So alſo though man only can ſpeak, yet Grammers work is general, and ſo we are to underſtand it, to anſwer in proportion to Logick, for as I ſee every thing with my eye of reaſon, ſo it is requiſite that after I have received it, I ſhould <hi>carry</hi> every thing to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and that I muſt do by Grammer: and Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer hath a double reference, one in regard of him

And for that diſtinction of <hi>vox</hi> to be <hi>primae</hi> or <hi>ſecundae intentionis,</hi> it is a toy: as <hi>animael</hi> ſay they, is <hi>primae intentionis genus ſecundae.</hi> But I would ask them is <hi>animal</hi> &amp; <hi>genus</hi> the ſame thing? No, for they belong to divers Arts: And <hi>genus</hi> in his own Art is as well <hi>primae intentionis</hi> as <hi>animal</hi> is, and it is a meer <hi>fallacia accidentis.</hi>

               <p>For Grammer is a general Art. <hi>Ergo, ens</hi> is his ſubject more remote, ſo that here he doth but ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cialize <hi>ens:</hi> ſo that <hi>vox</hi> is but the ſubject of Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer more ſpecial, <hi>unumquodque</hi> more general: and as <hi>affectio</hi> is to <hi>argumentum,</hi> ſo is <hi>vocatio</hi> to the thing called: ſo alſo that which was the <hi>aliquid</hi> in <hi>argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentum,</hi> as Grammer takes his notion of it, is <hi>unum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quodque:</hi> And that definition of <hi>nomen,</hi> of a thing that may be ſeen, felt, heard, or underſtood, is erroneous; for I can ſee, feel, or underſtand a thing, and yet name it not.

               <p>Again, Here we may ſee that verbs, adverbs, and conjunctions are <hi>voces;</hi> and hence we may ſee the definition of a Noune to be too general, and ſecondly, their errour in calling <hi>nomen</hi> not <hi>vox.</hi>

               <p>Here I am told how this <hi>nota</hi> is uſed, which is for the calling of a thing, and the naming of it; hence when we are asked what part of Speech ſuch a thing is, we are to know that the thing is no part of ſpeech, but the name of it: ſo it is <hi>fallacia diviſionis,</hi> when they ask, what part of Speech a whole Speech is.</p>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:115576:191"/>
               <p> It is a great queſtion which <hi>Scaliger</hi> in his Book, <hi>De cauſts linguae Latinae,</hi> whether words be <hi>ex theſi,</hi> or <hi>ad placitum?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But for Compound words they are <hi>ex theſi,</hi> as firſt words alſo in propriety of ſpeech; for we know that ſpeech is the creature of God, yea and that words ſignifie this or that thing, it is alſo from the providence of God: ſo God taught <hi>Adam</hi> to name the Creatures: and ſo God wrought the Confuſion of Tongues: Now man was to name them, and God by man; becauſe that ſpeech was to be the carrier betwixt man and man.</p>
               <p>Again, Man was to be the Lords Steward over his Creatures, and therefore he muſt know their names; and <hi>Adam</hi> did name things with reaſon, and according to his apprehenſion, which we may ſee by men now adayes that name things ſo, as, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their apprehenſion, they can give a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon thereof. So that words are given with reſpect to the thing named, and the reaſon of the things na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med is in the thing, ſo that words are not <hi>ad placi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum;</hi> ſo we give to little things little names, ſo in Engliſh things that are glib have their names run much upon <hi>(l)</hi> or other ſemi-vowels: if greater things, then their names run upon groſſer let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</p>
               <p>Now the Art of Speech is <hi>ars bexe ſermocinandi,</hi> for that is general both to Grammer and Rhetorick. And the wiſdom of God concerning Speech is double, pure, and ornate, and theſe are in the things, which Rhetorick ſhewes, in that there is rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in every Trope, and <hi>figura</hi> teacheth us to figu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate the Speech as the thing is; and if it be great,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:115576:192"/> we give it a great name: if little, we give it a little name.</p>
               <p>And hence do ariſe the three ſtiles of <hi>Tully,</hi> That for a lofty thing we have a lofty ſtile, for a mean thing a mean ſtile, for a little thing a low ſtile, and that with good reaſon, for Speech is the garment of Reaſon, and therefore ought not to be too little, or too great for it.</p>
               <p>And for their Rules theſe Arts are eternal though changed by man, which is <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſheth things by their names, and Rhetorick is the ſame to all the world.</p>
               <p>And ſo for Grammer, the Rule for variation is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal, though the variation of words be according to the variation of men, and this conſiſts either in ſingle words, or in conſtruction of more words, where alwayes note, that as the word governed doth depend upon the word that governeth it, ſo do the things.</p>

               <p>For <hi>ſonus</hi> is the material cauſe of it, the form is from the figuration of it with the inſtruments of the mouth: For the word <hi>litera</hi> ſome think it cometh from <hi>litteratura,</hi> and therefore write it with a double <hi>it,</hi> whereas it ſhould be with a ſingle <hi>t;</hi> ſome think it comes of <hi>lineatura,</hi> and ſo of <hi>linea,</hi> from the matter: ſome think it comes of <hi>litura</hi> a blot, which <hi>Scaliger</hi> believeth not, becauſe it is from the deſtruction of it: but this reaſon is more witty than ſound, for man is called <hi>mortalis</hi> of his
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:115576:192"/> death, but I think it comes of <hi>litura</hi> a blot, becauſe when we ſet black upon white, we do as it were blot the white paper: and ſo ſometime bloting and writing are confounded.</p>

               <p>The reaſon in nature is, becauſe there are two prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal ſorts of the poſition of the mouth: the <hi>firſt</hi> is when we make a ſound without any more ado: the <hi>ſecond</hi> is, where there is a more ſpecial kind of the uſe of the Organs in the mouth; which letters either make a complete ſound in themſelves, or an incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat; and even as in nature the firſt matter was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complete, yet makes things which are complete: ſo the Conſonants, which in themſelves are incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete, with vowels make ſyllables, which are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete.</p>
               <p>This word <hi>vocalis</hi> ſignifieth vocal, <hi>i. e.</hi> ſounding of himſelf; for he needeth no other, though he be joyned with another. Now for <hi>vocalis,</hi> they uſually define it <hi>litera quae per ſe ſyllabam poteſt efficere:</hi> this is <hi>à priore</hi> but not generally true, for in our Engliſh tongue our <hi>w, oo, ee,</hi> never make a complete ſound, neither in Hebrew, and yet there they make a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete ſound, though they be not without a conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant.</p>
               <p>Now for my own part, I would define a vowel to be <hi>litera quae completum ſonum edit,</hi> or <hi>quae plenè ſonat,</hi> or rather <hi>quae conſtat ſono completo;</hi> but in

                  </hi> yet we will ſpeak of them here. The reaſon therefore of length and ſhortneſs in ſpeech is this, The Lord hath appointed ſpeech to be the carrier from man to man, therefore it muſt be ſuch as will eaſily be received, therefore muſt be or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered by time and tune: for as every act is ordered with time, ſo muſt ſpeech be: Again, little things are to have little names, therefore ſhort names: great things great names, <hi>ergo,</hi> long names: now for a ſemi-ſhort, or the like, they belong to Muſick and not to Grammer. Now in our ſhort time we may be as long as we will, as men when they are angry will be as ſhort in the long, as at other times they are

                  <p>Now <hi>Plato</hi> being an honeſt man in Greece, and thoſe that were called <hi>Sophiſtae,</hi> abuſing this Art, and making the common people by it beleive, That God was evil, and truth falſhood: he was angry with them, and ſo called it The Art of Cookery, of Flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, of Painting, of Enchanting: though indeed it was by the fallacies of the Arguments in Logick: and thereupon that name <hi>Sophiſtae,</hi> which before was a name of honour, became afterwards a name of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach. Now (as I ſaid before) it was not Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torick, but falſe reaſon of Logick; only the Rheto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick ſet a gloſs upon it, and theſe names are as it <hi>Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to</hi> ſhould ſay, though this be a kind of Muſick which in it ſelf is good, yet thus it ought not to be uſed, but is unneedful, and therefore he calleth it a kind of ſauce, and painting out of a thing: or as if he ſhould ſay, a cup of poyſon fweetned with honey.

<pb n="32" facs="tcp:115576:197"/> The <hi>Romans</hi> of long time would not admit of Rhetorick, and among the Turks I think that they will never receive it: and indeed rude people, yea, and all kind of people are eaſily deceived by Rheto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick; not in regard of judgment, but of the affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of love, which embraceth it, and <hi>voluptas</hi> is the object of affection. Now indeed here lyeth the fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacy, in that a Speech being ſeaſoned with Rheto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick, paſſeth by the underſtanding, and ſo the Will takes hold of it, and whileſt the Will doth haſtily embrace it, the reaſon cannot examine it: and ſo in Tropes, it is reſpected of Rhetoricians to bring ſounding words to tickle the ear, but the underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is not well pleaſed, becauſe it doth not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand it: and Rhetorick is the art of affection as it ſweetneth the ſpeech, for the affection of love is ſo greedy of it that it will not let the underſtanding take it, therefore Rhetorick is ſaid to be the art of affection, Grammer of things to be underſtood; but this is nothing, for they are both of Speech and ſo are Arts to entertain <hi>bonum.</hi>

                  <p>Now for the <hi>Turks,</hi> I think they will never em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace it, for they are as God's rods to whip his Chriſtians withal. We have already heard what Rhetorick is: now followeth the diſtribution; and that is into Elocution and Pronunciation: for accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to rhe double act of this art muſt this art be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtributed, for we have already heard that Speech is God's Creature given unto man to be a Carrier from man to man; and that becauſe one man's eye cannot ſee all things, which being only a bare teſtimony, is not eaſily received, and therefore muſt be ſugared or ſauced, that it may be more ſweet and pleaſant, and
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:115576:197"/> alſo more evident. Now Speech is adorned by ſpeech, or by geſture, for though Speech be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered in geſture, yet not the Speech properly, but the ſound or tenour of it: For in that Oration, where both ſpeech and geſture are anſwerable one to another, that is moſt plain, and takes the moſt effect in the hearts of the hearers: and geſture is a kind of <hi>dicere,</hi> and therefore when they uſe pleading in Courts, they uſe geſture, that there may be a more pleaſant <hi>dicere</hi> conſiſting of theſe two parts: ſo that Speech is adorned either with ſpeech or geſture. The Firſt of theſe is called <hi>Elocutio</hi> of <hi>eloquor,</hi> which though for notation it be the ſame with <hi>pronuncia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio,</hi> yet in definition and in uſe they are diſtinct.

                     <hi>Oratio</hi> is properly the ſubject of Grammer, as <hi>ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio</hi> is of Logick.

Hence it follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that Rhetorick is a general Art, becauſe his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject <hi>oratio</hi> is general: yea, as general as Grammer. For howbeit in precept it be taught after it, yet for uſe the one is not where the other may not be; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is it after Grammer for ſubject or common uſe, but only in a kind of precedency of doctrine, even as Logick is before Grammer, only becauſe if we uſe Grammer which is the latter, Logick's uſe muſt be the former; as <hi>oratio</hi> ſhould not be before <hi>Ratio.</hi> Now becauſe Rhetorick is a general Art, hence it followeth, that it may be uſed in any art, if ſo be we have not a word without a trope, that is ſo uſual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and familiarly known, as the tropical word is: or if it be not of ſo great uſe as the tropical word is: for tropes do ariſe from the arguments in Logick; ſo that they do not only ſet a luſtre or reſplendency upon the word uſed, but alſo ſhew the argument from whence it is drawn. Which thing if <hi>Kecker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> had well conſidered, he would not have found fault with <hi>Ramus</hi> for uſing a trope in that word <hi>diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerere,</hi> both becauſe Rhetorick is general, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, becauſe that word <hi>diſſerere</hi> is of a thouſand times more uſe then any other word.</p>

               <head>CHAP. VI.</head>
               <p>VVE have heard the reaſon of this Art of Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torick, namely, that 'tis to ſweeten ſpeech with, otherwiſe being inartificial it is of little force in the hearers eares. For whereas every thing co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to mind, doth firſt come to the outward ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, then to the inward ſenſes, and hence to the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, &amp; ſo to the affections, and laſt of all to the Will. Rhetorick comes to the underſtanding, yet preſently, before it can examine it, the affections lay hold of it, and ſo, tickle the Will that it may approve it: and hence it came to be abuſed, 1. with ſophiſtry to the underſtanding; 2. for tickling of the Will.</p>
               <p>We have heard alſo that it hath two parts, namely, for that Speech is ſo; either writing, or uttering of it: hence is the double conſideration of ſpeech; the firſt whereof is called <hi>elocutio,</hi> which may be in writing alone without pronunciation, but pronunciation cannot be without elocution; hence it followeth that theſe are ſeveral parts: And ſecondly, <hi>Elocutio</hi> is before <hi>Pronunciatio:</hi> now <hi>elocutio</hi> is either in one word alone, adorning etymology; or in more words together adorning Syntax: that which is in one word alone is called <hi>tropus;</hi> and the reaſon of the ſweetneſſe of a Trope is, becauſe it doth not only give a ſplendour, but beſides that it carrieth us to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother Argument from whence it was drawn: for every Trope ſignifieth two things to the hearer:</p>
               <pb n="51" facs="tcp:115576:206"/>
               <p> Firſt, A kind of ſweetneſſe with the thing it deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereth: and ſecondly, the argument whence it was drawn. Therefore though at the firſt neceſſity found it out, yet afterwards variety did ſo delight that it would not caſt them off. Now theſe Tropes are not of any words as we will, but of conſentanies with conſentanies, diſſent. with diſſent. &amp;c. and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the diſtribution of the doctrine of Tropes muſt run along according as the arguments are diſtribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: yet we have not fit words to diſtribute them withal, for if we ſhould have ſaid that a Trope is ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſimple or comparate, then we ſhould have left out thoſe Tropes which do ariſe from <hi>orta argumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta,</hi> as, <hi>ſynecdoche integri, &amp; membri, generis &amp; ſpeciei.</hi> Again, not every ſimple argument is put for every ſimple one; neither every comp. for every comp. ſo that in this diſtribution there would have been a double errour, therefore he contents himſelf with the ſpecial words <hi>Metonym.</hi> and <hi>Ironia,</hi> commending unto us a <hi>totum</hi> which we are to imagine by theſe ſpecials as they have a community one with another, which is in regard of the arguments from whence they ariſe.</p>
               <p n="1">1. For a metonymy of the cauſe, that is either of the efficient or of the matter: The reaſon of theſe two Tropes is, becauſe theſe two cauſes in conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the effect, are precedent a good while before either forme or end. Now here, firſt the efficient is put for the effect, for that often times giveth names to the effect: and this metonymy hath two <hi>modi,</hi> the firſt when the Inventour is put for the thing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented; the ſecond when the Authour is put for the thing effected: ſo, we call <hi>Ramus</hi> his Logick, <hi>Ramus:</hi>
                  <pb n="52" facs="tcp:115576:207"/> and the reaſon hereof is this, becauſe at the firſt we had not readily a name for it; for the thing being new we could not haſtily give it a name, but gave the Author's name, till we had a better for it: So, for the matter we call Money ſilver, becauſe at the firſt we had not readily a better name. Now there are no Tropes, of the formal and final cauſes; and the reaſon is, becauſe they were ſo confuſed with the effect, that at the firſt we cannot readily ſever them, both becauſe <hi>forma ſimul ingenita cum effecto:</hi> and ſecondly, becauſe theſe two cauſes do work ſo near to the effect a good while after either efficient or matter.</p>
               <p n="2">2. A metonymy of the effect is, when the effici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent is ſignified by his effects: here he ſeemeth to make the effect only to anſwer to the efficient; but it doth anſwer alſo to the matter at leaſt, though not in Latin, yet in Hebrew and Engliſh: <hi>Luz</hi> was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Bethel</hi> before it was <hi>Bethel.</hi> Now this metony<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my of the effect hath two <hi>modi:</hi> The firſt, when the effect is given to the efficient adjectively: the ſecond when given to the efficient not adjectively, but ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtractively: as he ſaid, Death was in the Pot, becauſe Colliquintida was in it. Now as the cauſe is put for the effect, <hi>&amp; contrà;</hi> ſo, the ſubj. for the adj. <hi>&amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trà.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. In the metonymy of the ſubject the <hi>modi</hi> are ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>contin. pro re contenta,</hi> as <hi>locus pro incolis, &amp; ad res locatas;</hi> or <hi>poſſeſſor pro re poſſeſſâ;</hi> or <hi>Dux pro exercitu;</hi> or <hi>Advocatus pro Cliente.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. Now followeth the metonymy of the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junct.</p>
               <div type="part">

                  <head>Cùm ex adj. res ſubj. ſignifie.</head>
                  <p>That is, when the name of an adjunct is given to the ſubj. whereof 'tis an adjunct: So we uſe to ſay, <hi>Saving your Honour: If it pleaſe your Worſhip: Honour</hi> and <hi>Worſhip</hi> being put for the ſubjects there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of: for, becauſe the term of the cauſe, effect, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, and adj. did not at the firſt come readily to our hand, therefore we were fain to put cauſe for effect, ſubj. for adj. <hi>aut contrà.</hi> So, the names of Vertues and Vices are put for vertuous and vitious men: as Lecher for a lecherous man; Covetouſneſs for a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetous man, &amp;c. and this is the firſt <hi>modus</hi> of this metonymy.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond <hi>modus</hi> is, when the ſigne is put for the thing ſigned; as, <hi>pubes</hi> for <hi>inventus;</hi> for <hi>pubes</hi> is properly the budding of the beard; when he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginneth to be <hi>adoleſcens.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The third <hi>modus</hi> is, when the adjunct of time is put for the ſubject; as <hi>time</hi> for the unmannerly Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens in that time: ſo <hi>aſpera ſaecula</hi> for the People that were then <hi>aſperi;</hi> ſo is <hi>togae</hi> for Peace, and here <hi>[cedant arma togae, conced. &amp;c.]</hi> are two Hyper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boly's.</p>

                  <p>Some words therefore (ſaith he) are to be put back, and ſome to be put before: and even as in buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of Stones, every ſtone muſt not be laid as they come next to hand, but as they will beſt lye together: ſo nothing will make a more ſweet ſpeech than a fit mutation of the order of words.

               <p>THis is the commendation of <hi>Tully</hi> of oratorical number in feet, which ought to be much more acceptable to us than to the Author himſelf, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing enwraped with the Schools and Comments of Rhetoricians thought this act to be moſt hard which is in twenty orations obſerved by <hi>Ramus</hi> and ſhewed to be moſt eaſie; ſo much more excellent was the Oratours nature and uſe than his art. Now here was but one rule which was generally taught before, namely, That oratorical number be unlike both to Poetry and it ſelf: here he doth <hi>commorari</hi> and tells us that therefore in proſe we muſt not uſe verſe; yet ſometimes you may for authority or pleaſure, as <hi>Tully</hi> of old did uſing the example of the <hi>Athenians:</hi> The
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:115576:221"/> next rule is, that we make not the beginning or end of a verſe, the beginning or end of proſe; neither that we begin or end our Oration with any ſentence like to verſe: though indeed in the beginning there is leſſe care, becauſe there it comes new, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the people are ready to paſs it away, and in the middle of an Oration there is no conſideration at all, but in the end muſt be greateſt care of all: hence O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratours uſe to place ſome good Arguments in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, the worſt in the middle, and the beſt at the latter end: now the end is moſt to be regarded be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it doth moſt appear, and is beſt underſtood by the people; ſo that though the beginning and middle, which peradventure they have forgot, were not good, yet the concluſion being good, they will judge all the reſt to be good alſo: now in Oratory we are to obſerve the laſt ſix ſyllables of a clauſe <hi>quae biſſyllabis tantùm pedibus definiri poteſt:</hi> neither muſt we be too curious in obſerving the ſyllables of every clauſe. Now he comes to the ſpecials, and there he tells us that all ſyllables long, make a ſlow and a rare clauſe; yet if they be all long, 'tis not amiſs in a grave matter: but all ſhort are more rare than all long; for there 'tis too ſwift, and that ſpeech doth not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the gravity of an Oratory, but long and ſhort together are more uſual. Here note, that, as in Poetry, ſo alſo in Oratory, <hi>nihil ſit, extrema illa longa ſit, an brevis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now this Oratorical number is learned two ways, either by taking a well ſet ſentence and diſplacing the words to ſee how they will ſound, or to take ſome ſentence which is diſſolved, and to place it bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Now there muſt be ſuch variety of feet in Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory,
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:115576:222"/> as that of <hi>Licinius,</hi> that ſweet words are framed as Carvers work by art, and pavement engra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven with—or the like; and the oratorical num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber doth as well regard the ſound of the letters, namely, that one word do not end with a vowel, and the next word begin with a vowel; neither that Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torical ſentences run upon one letter, as, <hi>O tite, tute, tate, &amp;c.</hi> but that the conſonants ſound well as it doth reſpect the meaſure of the ſyllables.</p>

And ſo <hi>anima</hi> is <hi>in corpore tanquam adjunctum in ſubjecto,</hi> And, (by the way) <hi>anima eſt tota in toto, &amp; tota in qualibet parte,</hi> is falſe; for <hi>anima</hi> is finite, and if it ſhould be <hi>tota in qualibet parte,</hi> then it ſhould be ſo by the ſame reaſon that we ſay God is <hi>totus in qualibet parte,</hi> and ſo is God: ſo that 'tis but <hi>pars in parte:</hi> again it hath limits of quantity, <hi>ergo</hi> it hath ſome figure, <hi>ergo partem extra partem, ergo</hi> poſition of parts. And <hi>primum materiale</hi> is made of nothing, and ſo is next unto nothing, ſo that nature looks at it as it doth conſtitute things. And from theſe we may prove Divinity, for every thing is made of nothing, and ſo by the ſame power may be reſolved into nothing: ſo that nature teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth nothing contrary to Divinity. And from theſe are all qualities: and all qualities have their quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty according to their ſubject; ſo Learning, when I
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:115576:226"/> ſay, Such an one is great Schollar. But <hi>Objection,</hi> Some will ſay, <hi>What to be meaſured with a yard?</hi> No, but if a good Logician, then ſo far forth as his Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick reacheth.</p>

                  <hi>Pricipium eſt materiale, formale.]</hi> From theſe <hi>principia</hi> may we conclude any thing. And by how much more forme and leſs matter any thing hath; ſo much more action there is. But</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> The continuance of motion is no hurt to any thing; for 'tis but to extend the matter, and bring it in frame: and hence 'tis that there is more action in ſome things than in other things. So the Angels do moſt act, for they have moſt forme: yet we are to think that they have the three dimenſions; and many of them cannot be together, for there ſhould be <hi>penetratio dimenſionum, ergo eſſentiarum.</hi> And there in the definition of Nature, we heard of <hi>ortus,</hi> becauſe that is general to every nature to be <hi>orta à principiis.</hi> But <hi>interitus</hi> belongeth only to <hi>inconſtans natura.</hi> So that 'tis no good conſequence to ſay, ſuch a thing had <hi>ortum, ergo</hi> it muſt have <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teritum:</hi> and the reaſon is, becauſe Angels and the higheſt Heavens have their <hi>principla congenita,</hi> and <hi>ergo,</hi> nature cannot diſſolve them. The Earth hath leſs forme than Watter; for if it had the forme of Water upon it, it would occupie more room. So that 'tis not from the matter, but from the form. And every nature hath theſe two <hi>principia;</hi> the <hi>principium paſſionis</hi> is from the matter, <hi>actionis</hi> from the forme. And from theſe come limits of eſſence &amp; of quantity, which reaches ſo far as the form extends the matter:
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:115576:227"/> ſo the matter of earth reacheth ſo far as the form ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends it, otherwiſe the matter of it might further be extended. And here is that queſtion amongſt Phyſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, <hi>Whether Hairs and Nayles be parts of man, or not?</hi> For if the forme extends it ſelf ſo far, (which it doth not) then they ſhould be parts. <hi>Scaliger</hi> ſaith, the Angels have quantity, but not praedicamental, but ſpiritual quantity; which is nothing but their ſubtile quantity: and becauſe they have quantity, hence they muſt be under ſome figure, and they have their place, and that is one.</p>

                  <hi>Gravitas</hi> and <hi>Levitas</hi> do ariſe from the continual act of the forme: for where there is a great deal of forme, and little matter, there is moſt levity. So in the higheſt Heavens, becauſe the <hi>principia</hi> were to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and there is much acting of the forme, hence is it moſt light, and hath the higheſt place. And gravity is a privation as it were of levity, as opacity is of light. And ſo the ſame matter may be more light by the action of the forme, not more grave. And ſo the firſt matter was moſt grave, becauſe it was with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:115576:228"/> forme: and as it was every thing imperfectly ſo 'twas in <hi>loco,</hi> and was <hi>quantum</hi> imperfectly; though limits of place and quantity be ſo far as matter and form reach: and 'twas without forme, <hi>ergo</hi> imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect. And for ſo many legions of Spirits in a mans body, we are to imagine them to have diſtinct places; ſo when we pull a thing, we would have it in two places, <hi>ergo</hi> it rents. And acts are either internal, when the forme extends the matter; and hence is <hi>ſubtilitas</hi> and <hi>craſſities,</hi> and this is the true ariſing of <hi>ſubtilitas,</hi> ſome ſay it ariſeth from heat, and rarity: but there may be ſubtility where theſe are not, as in the higheſt Heavens: and this is plain in the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which have one common matter, and yet by their forms they are more or leſs extended: neither is heat the cauſe of extenſion, for the earth will be more extended, if the forme of Water be in it. Again, when the form extends the matter beyond its reach, till it rent, this is rarity: <hi>Gravitas</hi> is from more matter, and leſs forme, <hi>levitas contrà:</hi> The external act is of the matter and forme. <hi>Raritas</hi> and <hi>Denſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tas.</hi> Rarity is the extenſion of the matter by the forme, that it rents and becomes poroſe, and ſo is every thing, for if Angels can extend themſelves, then tis from their rarity and denſity, and <hi>ergo</hi> from poroſity: and ſo for <hi>Adam,</hi> and the patriarchs, and the reſt, they being in the higheſt Heavens, there muſt needs be <hi>ceſſio corporum,</hi> and there muſt be no <hi>vacuum, ergo</hi> there is a <hi>caeleſtis aura</hi> that doth <hi>cedere.

               <p>The world conſiſteth of many parts, which are not <hi>continua,</hi> but <hi>contigua:</hi> yet we may call the world one, as he that made it is one; <hi>ſcilicet</hi> in method or order, not in continued quantity. And by reaſon, that all things are one by method, hence there can be no <hi>vacuum:</hi> Firſt, becauſe there would be a <hi>crypſis</hi> of this method: again, <hi>vacuum</hi> is <hi>non ens;</hi> but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>ens à primo</hi> is part of the world, <hi>ergo</hi> not <hi>non ens,</hi> for nothing cannot be a part of ſomething. Nature is manifold, but 'tis made one by method: as every rule of Logick are divers in themſelves, but make but one act by method, ſo nature being manifold in it ſelf, is made one by method. And here are a great many Controverſies anſwered; as, That the world is
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:115576:229"/> not one by continuity but method, we know is the wiſdom of God, according to which God created and governs things; <hi>ergo</hi> the things do <hi>appetere</hi> their place, as God hath placed them: hence 'tis that things aſcend and deſcend. Some ſay 'tis for their own preſervation: which indeed is the final cauſe, but the efficient cauſe is method. And as a Painter, when he paints a thing, ſhould make a deformity, if he ſhould ſet things out of order: ſo nature, if things ſhould not be rightly placed, ſo that there be no <hi>crypſis</hi> of method. And here comes in the world, which is <hi>multiplex</hi> and <hi>diſcontinua natura:</hi> here alſo by reaſon of this method there comes to be conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guity of every thing; ſo that there cannot be <hi>va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuum:</hi> for then the world ſhould not be one, and ſo we ſhould make two worlds, and make nothing ſomething. And though Gods wiſdom, Power, and other Attributes, be, and in God, yet he would have them appear <hi>inſtar omnium,</hi> and to be ſufficient for all things: and ſo he made them many, to ſhew the variety of this wiſdom. Now again, as they are many in themſelves, yet they muſt be but one, to ſhew that the variety of this wiſdom is but one in him. And they are in one method, and ſo make one world. So we ſay in Logick, and 'tis ſometimes true, That the cauſe and the effect be like: and ſo is God and the world. So the world is but one: and is round, as being the moſt capacious figure of all: now 'tis one, not in continuity, for then it ſhould but have one quantity, and ſo one forme, but as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in contiguity as it were <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, <hi>i. e.</hi> an heap, but an orderly heap, and ſo is but one in method. And hence every thing deſireth its place and order
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:115576:229"/> by the rule of method; which commands that <hi>natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>râ prior</hi> muſt <hi>praecedere: ergo</hi> the outmoſt things muſt firſt be made; and <hi>ergo</hi> they muſt have more forme than matter, that they may aſcend: and ſo by order, from the higheſt nature, goeth down to the loweſt: And for thoſe Philoſophers which make Nature to be God, I doubt it, and methinks 'tis like their o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion which made the God-head the form of every thing. But we muſt not wrong God, but acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the <hi>principia</hi> to be cauſes of things, and give them their effects, for they ſay in that ſuch qualities—ſuch a thing, 'tis from God: But as a man doth write with pen, ſo God hath made a creature which worketh of it ſelf, even as the Pen writeth, but is governed by God even as the pen by the writer. So that natures work is when the two cauſes do work according to Gods <hi>Logicum artificium:</hi> and Nature is the cauſe of natural effects; and is to be diſtinguiſhed from God. So that here we ſee the diſpoſition and order of every thing. So when I ſee a Tree bring forth fruit, I conclude there is Logick; and yet neither tree nor fruit hath reaſon: <hi>ergo</hi> there is one greater that hath reaſon: which methinks were ſufficient to convert any Atheiſt. And from this or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of things comes contiguity: for there muſt be no <hi>vacuum,</hi> as before, ſince that would be a breach of method. So we ſee Water and Earth will go up even into the element of Fire for the preſervation of the unity of this world. And if there ſhould be a <hi>vacuum</hi> it muſt needs be ſomething or nothing, then in the world or out of the world; if out of the world, then it were not all things; if in the world, then a part of the world, then as before in <hi>ens</hi> it ſhould be
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:115576:230"/> 
                  <hi>ens;</hi> if in the world and not <hi>ens,</hi> then the world muſt be two. And from method 'tis that the Load-ſtone deſireth to ſtand North and South; and ſo doth every thing, yea naturally, not guided by coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel deſire <hi>natale ſolum.</hi> And when we do tranſplant trees, 'tis a monſter and againſt nature; and ſo that one woman ſhould nurſe an other womans child: And one woman may have three children, though ſhe have but two dugs, ſo that ſhe have milk for them. And from ſympathy it is, that the iron goeth to the load-ſtone, for 'tis his food; <hi>ergo</hi> his preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving cauſe; and the ſtone may act through a Table. For <hi>deſcenſus.</hi> What is the reaſon that fire cometh down? Common Philoſophers aſcribe it to plate, which belongeth to <hi>ſubjectum;</hi> but 'tis place, which is order, and belongeth to method: and that is the next cauſe, though the final cauſe be as before, <hi>ne detur vacuum.</hi> So when I caſt a ſtone, that it flies, 'tis <hi>propria forma;</hi> the reaſon why it flies from me is that it doth <hi>pati,</hi> and <hi>ergo</hi> doth flie his enemy. The common Philoſophers aſcribe it to the air, which in very deed doth hinder it as themſelves ſhall confeſs; for caſt a ſtone upward, and when it falleth down again, what is the reaſon it moveth faſter when 'tis near the center, than when tis farther off, but becauſe when tis near the center there is leſs reſiſtance of the air than there was above? So what is the reaſon we take force to ſtrike with an Ax, and that goes far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, than if we ſet it upon a thing and lay great weight on it? becauſe the wood can reſiſt the Ax well enough. Now we lift up our hands, becauſe all the vital ſpirits in the legs and other parts of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy come to inable that part which acteth moſt; and
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:115576:230"/> the higher it goeth the more forciblly it cometh, for that it is more able to reſiſt the air; as alſo there is a double motion, natural and violent: and it will come down more eaſily, becauſe it is a natural moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; not upward ſo well becauſe tis violent unto it. So a thing that hangs down, that part moveth moſt which is fartheſt from the center, for that it ſuffereth violence. So what's the reaſon, that put ſalt Beef in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Sea and it will be freſh; but put freſh in, and it will be ſalt? becauſe tis the nature of ſalt to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtringe; and that's the reaſon ſalt Beef occupieth leſs place than freſh doth: now its pores being filled with ſalt, the ſalt water cannot get in, but only the fine water pierceth in, and ſo takes away the ſalt: but if it be freſh the pores be ſo open, that the ſalt water entreth in, and ſo it becometh ſalt.</p>

<pb n="100" facs="tcp:115576:231"/> them, it could work a miracle, which is above na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, for nature found them created, and muſt ſo leave them, for <hi>creatio</hi> and <hi>annihilatio</hi> are not effects of nature, but above it: Hence the ſoul of man could not be created by nature; for then either of ſomething or nothing; not of nothing. For <hi>creatio</hi> is above nature, if of ſomething, then reſolvable a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain. Again, if every thing in nature be of theſe <hi>principia,</hi> hence is <hi>generatio ex aliquo,</hi> and <hi>corruptio in aliquid;</hi> from theſe <hi>principia</hi> comes <hi>actus &amp; poten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia; actus eſt ex acto formae in materiam; potentia eſt ex actu formae per materiam:</hi> From theſe inward acts come (1) levity and gravity; and there are two cauſes of levity, the firſt is a form more active; the ſecond is leſs proportion of matter: The cauſes of gravity are <hi>contra:</hi> again the cauſes of ſubtility are more proportion of forme, and more active, and leſs proportion of matter: again rarity and denſity are degrees of poroſity; and every thing is poroſe; ſo Angels do contract themſelves, by retracting (as I may ſay) themſelves into their pores; neither need we to fear <hi>vacuum ergo,</hi> in the higheſt heavens; for there is a <hi>caleſtis aura</hi> to prevent it: ſo alſo the higheſt heavens are poroſe, neither is there any door to open and ſhut, but God doth that at his pleaſure: ſo alſo fire can extend and tontract it ſelf, and that becauſe of rarity and ſo poroſity; much more <hi>ergo</hi> the Angels. And extenſion and contraction comes from poroſity: which will plainly appear in the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lements which are together by appoſition; for one is in the pores of an other; and this is that which <hi>Kickerman</hi> calls a miſture; and indeed beſides this ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition there is a kind of imperfect miſture in them,

<pb n="105" facs="tcp:115576:233"/> Again, they are <hi>actuoſiſſimae,</hi> for they muſt prevail with the inconſtant natures: hence they have moſt forme and leaſt matter: hence they are moſt light, and ſo have the higheſt place: Again moſt ſubtile and rare, hence is their great extenſion and little contraction: moſt ſubtile; hence their matter moſt pure and fine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſpun. Our Divines ſay the matter of the higheſt heavens and of the elements is all one, but I would rather call the higheſt heavens a <hi>quintae eſſentia</hi> with <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> for tis not <hi>commiſcible</hi> as the Elements are.</p>

               <p>In Divinity they are called Angels of their office and place: and their matter is the fame with the higheſt heavens: as thoſe creatures which live in the earth have moſt earth in them, and thoſe that are in the water, air, or fire, have moſt water, air, and fire. And the Angels have leaſt matter, and moſt forme of any: hence are they moſt ſubtile: hence in their greateſt condenſation ſo fine, that we cannot ſee them. And theſe have reaſon whereby they ſee moſt accutely all other things; for they are made for God and mans uſe. They have Will alſo, for where there is Reaſon, there muſt be Will. And thirdly, they have local motion; which is by extenſion as the Sun beams. And in the good Angels there is no ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riority and inferiority: but in the evil, <hi>Beelzebub</hi> is ſaid to be the chief: which is but only the oppoſing of him to Chriſt of <hi>Bagnal Zebub.</hi> They are moſt active of any thing, having moſt forme and leaſt matter of any thing: and they are <hi>cum ratione &amp; vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntate,</hi> active, becauſe they have the greateſt charge of any creature: <hi>cum ratione,</hi> that they may do wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; <hi>cum voluntate,</hi> that they may do it cheerful: and ſo they are ſaid to do the Will of God ſpeedily, willingly, and wittingly. They have leaſt matter: hence can they ſo extend it; and hence they are ſo ſubtile. Again they are moſt active <hi>per materiam:</hi> hence moſt ſwift in motion: which motion is by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſion, and ſo by this celerity contracted again. Some Philoſophers hold, That the Angels move the
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:115576:234"/> heavens; and their reaſon is, becauſe their motion is ſo wonderful. But ſo they may ſay, the Angels move a Plant, becauſe it brings forth an apple which is ſo wounderful. Now theſe Angels having ſo ſubtile matter; hence in their greateſt condenſation, they are far beyond the edge of our eye to ſee them: hence are they called ſpiritual from their ſubtili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.

Again, the Angels are ſo ſtrong: hence tis that the enemy can break down trees and houſes, and caſt down ſteeples: ſo the Soul of man is ſwift, and is not as ſome think in one part principally, but in every part of man: and according as the body encreaſeth, ſo doth it extend it ſelf. Hence alſo an Angel being ſo ſtrong, can carry a man, as he did <hi>Philip.</hi> The Angels do underſtand a thing as we do mediately; elſe they ſhould do it by a miracle, for they cannot ſee Gods <hi>idea</hi> but when he pleaſeth: and God hath geniſed every thing, <hi>ergo</hi> they muſt analyſe it, and that by the ſame Logick that we do: yea, and they do labour and obſerve by induction of ſingulars as we do.

So the fire cauſeth heat in it ſelf, and outwardly alſo when it is condenſated: ſo in—its parts are united and <hi>ergo</hi> it will burn which ſheweth it muſt needs be hot: and from this heat followeth the quality of brightneſs; which is chiefly in the fire for that is <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="112" facs="tcp:115576:237"/> Indeed the fire by reaſon of the forms act on the matter is more ſubtile than the other elements; and hence wil more eaſily enter into the pores of them and ſo raraifie them. But put leather into the fire and it will condenſate that and make it ſhrink by reaſon of the moiſture in it; and ſo the earth is left dry. So it rarifies the air in getting into the pores of it, and drives away its forme, and ſo makes it (by extending it) the more ſubtile, and carieth it with it. So in a gun, the fire's form acting upon the matter cannot be kept in ſuch a little room: <hi>ergo</hi> it burſts out of the gun and breaks the air.

               <p>
                  <hi>Frigidum</hi> is water or earth: cold is in both theſe by reaſon their forms are not ſo active, and their matter is more abundant and more—, and this appeares in divers extending of the ſame matter having divers forms. So if the ſame matter have the form of water it will be cold; if of air it will be moiſt; if of fire it will be hot: <hi>ergo</hi> theſe qualities are from the greater and leſser act of the form. Theſe elements are cold becauſe they have more matter or leſs form. So they ſay the Moon is cold, becauſe ſhe takes up vapours and yet not able to take them up to the fire leaves them and they become cold. ſo put luke-warme water to ſcalding water and it will be more cold; becauſe it dulleth the forms act of the ſcalding water. Now in the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments there is one common matter to them all: now that one is more ſubtil and another more denſe; tis from the forms act upon the matter; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the forms act alone nor the mattes alone: but both together cauſe theſe qualities; which indeed are rather acts than qualities So the fire doth act continually. Now as the form doth act inwardly upon the matter; ſo we ſay tis habitual: as it is act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by them both outwardly and ſo more ſenſibly, ſo we call it an act. So the vegetative foul doth conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:115576:238"/> vegetate. And in theſe I ſay there is more matter &amp; leſs form: hence the form is clogged with the matter that it cannot act, and ſo tis dull; as a beetle againſt a wool ſack. <hi>Frigidum</hi> where there is more matter than form; that is, the proportion of the matter is greater than the proportion of the forme. Hence tis probable that the firſt matter was equally devided into four elements, and that one had at the firſt as much as an other, but after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards according as the form did extend or contract them; ſo came one to be greater than the other, <hi>aut contra.</hi> But here it may be <hi>Objected,</hi> Is the water greater than the earth? or was it as great as the earth? Yes, the water was greater than the earth for quantity: ſo at <hi>Noe</hi>'s flood we read how high it was above the higheſt hils: again we know it o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verflowed the whole earth, though God now for the preſervation of his creatures, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> were to live upon the earth, hath devided the waters, and hath plac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſome of them above in the firmament, and ſome of them below on the earth; and but for the waters in hollow places in the earth, the <hi>diameter</hi> of the earth would be a great deal leſs. And that the hils are ſo many ciſterns to hold water tis plain, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe water comes out of hils, and the earth is full of water, ſo the river <hi>Niger</hi> runneth under the earth; ſo the river <hi>Aeſopus</hi> runneth under the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diterrane ſea; ſo that though ſome object, that the ſea is but in ſome parts ſome 2 miles deep, yet there are many waters under the earth. <hi>Frigidum eſt aqua et terra.</hi> Water firſt, where there is more matter &amp; leſs form, but not in proportion with the earth. Hence be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the abundance of their matter theſe ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:115576:239"/> are ſeeable: the other elements being hot are not ſeeable, and that with great reaſon, namely that we might more perfectly and more cleerly ſee the things that move in them which we could not have done ſo well had they been ſeeable: as in water we cannot ſo perfectly ſee fiſh. Water is moſt cold and moiſt by reaſon of the forms act being more active than the form of earth. But how then is it moſt cold? Becauſe, though the form act more than the form of earth, yet the matter doth ſo ſtrongly <hi>reagere,</hi> that 'tis more ſenſibly cold becauſe of the greater action and paſſion; even as when a ball or a ſtone is caſt forcibly unto me, if I meet it with my hand it doth more ſenſibly <hi>agere,</hi> than if I take it gent ly in my hand. 'Tis alſo moiſt, becauſe it being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly cold is alſo moiſt, and moiſture cauſeth ſoftneſs; ſo that ſoftneſs is a quality ariſing from moiſture and is properly of the air and ſecondly of the water. The earth is moſt dry: becauſe the form of it is ſo little active, cannot extend it <hi>ergo</hi> to make it fluid, and ſo it makes it dry. Fire is more fluid than the earth but not ſo dry: air having heat which doth extend, moiſture makes it moſt moiſt but not dry. Again tis cold but not actually as water, becauſe the form doth not act ſo much upon it, as the form of water upon water. Again hence the earth is moſt ſolid and leaſt porous of any of the elements. Again the earth is moſt dark and opake of all the elements; the air and water are capable of light and opacitie: becauſe the creatures that live in them, have a ſenſible life, and ſhould have light and darkneſs night and day. Thus much of the elements ſimply conſidered as they are elements:
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:115576:239"/> now there is not only an appoſition of them, but a kind of imperfect miſture; for they cannot give <hi>ſapor</hi> and ſuch other qualities as they have, but as they are <hi>miſta: Ergo</hi> we ſhall hear of them again in the meteors, as alſo of the regions of the air, and of <hi>mare,</hi> and of other rivers which are meteors.</p>

                  <hi>Elementare eſt quod ex elementis eſt. Ergo</hi> for its matter 'tis made immediately of the <hi>materiale prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipium:</hi> and for the forme of it, 'tis made <hi>proximè ex formis elementorum.</hi>

               <p>Obj. <hi>But then the forms of things ſhould be compoſed?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> So they are: even as the body is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed of many parts, which are compoſed of many ſimilar parts, which contain both matter and form. Again, <hi>Miſtio eſt miſcibilium alteratorum unio. Ergo</hi> 'tis <hi>miſtio</hi> that makes a thing <hi>unum:</hi> then muſt the forms be <hi>miſta,</hi> and ſo compoſite, for that makes the thing <hi>unum.</hi> Now for thoſe that ſay the forms of things are from the influences, I would ask them, What it is that unites the matter and form together: for in Logick we know there is nothing betwixt the matter and the form? Some ſay that ſpirit is the <hi>vinculum</hi> of the ſoul and body: yea, but the ſoul is not the form: and again, what ſhall unite them in a ſtone where there is no ſuch ſpirit? <hi>Object.</hi> 2. Some deny the forms of the elements to be in the miſt: But if they be not; how do they return into the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments again: and again 'tis granted by all that the qualities are there, <hi>ergo</hi> their forms muſt be there: and the elements are <hi>actu</hi> in the miſt; yea, and are agents there as we ſhall hear hereafter in <hi>miſtione.</hi> Now the greateſt <hi>objection</hi> I find againſt this, is this;
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:115576:240"/> ſay they, How can things without life cauſe things to live? There may be a <hi>vivens</hi> of them, becauſe <hi>ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma vegetiva,</hi> and <hi>ſenſitiva</hi> are nouriſhed by nutri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: for <hi>ſpiritus vitalis</hi> is the vegetative ſoul, which is nouriſhed by <hi>humidum radicale,</hi> and hath air pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dominating in it; and <hi>ſpirit us animalis</hi> is that ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive ſoul which is nouriſhed by moiſture and heat, and hath fire predominating in it: and the common people do uſe to ſay that theſe do <hi>vaneſcere in auras:</hi> and the <hi>ſpiritus animalis</hi> is made of the vital ſpirit, and the vital ſpirit is made of a natural ſpirit which ariſeth from the meat which we eat: <hi>ergo</hi> if theſe can nouriſh and keep life, they can alſo cauſe life. If they ſhall ſay the vital ſpirit is not made of the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, then it muſt be made of nothing, and ſo ſhould be eternal in nature. <hi>Keckerman</hi> ſaith, the elements are <hi>corpora incompleta;</hi> which is moſt falſe, for they ſhould not exiſt but in compoſites; but they do in themſelves, for they are effects. I rather chuſe this word <hi>elementarium</hi> than <hi>miſtum,</hi> becauſe <hi>miſtum</hi> is but an adjunct to it. <hi>Elementarium eſt quod eſt ex ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentis;</hi> and ſo the firſt matter, but at the ſecond hand: and hence it appears that the elements go in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the <hi>miſtum.</hi> But the greateſt <hi>Objection</hi> that ever I met with concerning this, is that, <hi>How can things which have not life, cauſe life?</hi> Yes: For life is but an act, and a compoſite act: Again, life is preſerved and maintained by the elements, <hi>ergo</hi> may be cauſed by them; ſo the animal ſpirits are made of the vital, and the vital of the elements, not only as they are acts, but alſo as they are <hi>membra,</hi> for there is no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſoul in Plants and Beaſts, for they are next to the reaſonable ſoul. Now if they ſhall ſay theſe
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:115576:240"/> ſpirits vital and animal be not made of the elements, but of ſome other thing, I would ask them, Of what, of the ſpirits which are in the meat? Then the forms of Plants and Beaſts muſt be made of the forms of Herbs, and of ſuch things as they feed on. if they will ſay, they be made of the influences; they are then either accidents, which cannot be forms, or ſubſtances: if ſubſtances, then they ſhould be porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the matter and forme of the Stars, and then the ſtars ſhould not remain the ſame thing. <hi>Miſtio,</hi> they ſay is <hi>alteratorum unio;</hi> ſo that in the framing of the forms of things there muſt be an alteration and another forme diſtinct from any of theſe forms from whence it did ariſe: even as in a Cheſt made of boards, I cannot in propriety of ſpeech call them boards, but a Cheſt made of theſe boards: So in the things that are miſt I cannot ſay, the elements forms are their forms, but tis a miſt forme compoſed of the elements which are incomplete in the miſt. So that true 'tis there is an alteration, but a generation alſo; though generation will not ſerve the turn, becauſe there is not a corruption of the elements, which make the things: neither indeed do generation and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption go alwayes together, for when a chicken is made of an egg, there is not a corruption but a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting of the egg, neither is there <hi>acquiſitio novae formae,</hi> but <hi>veteris perfectio.</hi> And the elements are members of the elementaries: but a part of fire is not a <hi>membrum</hi> of fire, but part of the matter and form of fire. Now here is the chief queſtion, How theſe are in the miſt. Firſt of all, the elements by the mutual action and paſſion of their matter and forme are holden together, and make one ſimple thing:
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:115576:241"/> and now theſe have one common matter, but diſtinct forms, and ſo are oppoſite, which will <hi>ergo</hi> fight to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and one flie the other, except there be ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to hold them together: hence it appears there muſt be more things than one in a miſt. Now con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traries will ſoon deſtroy one another, except they have ſome ſtickler, as I ſuppoſe air comes to earth and makes it clammy; then the water comes to tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate earths drineſs, that it cannot overcome the airs moiſture; then the fire comes to water to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain airs heat: ſo that there is a <hi>diſcors concordia</hi> and a <hi>concors diſcordia;</hi> and then all the forms muſt ſo act as one doth not <hi>dominare</hi> over another, as 'tis in things imperfectly mixed, which do not <hi>ergo</hi> long continue: ſo that the forms act muſt here needs be abated. Again the matter is but one, <hi>ergo</hi> it is na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures care to keep every little particle of the matter with its form there temperately acting. And being ſo cloſe and ſo divided, hence 'tis that they are far beyond the <hi>acies</hi> of our eyes to ſee them; which is plain in natural things; and ſo in artificial things, we ſee ſometimes cloath made of wooll of ſo many colours, which are ſo finely mingled in the cloath that we can hardly diſtinguiſh all the colours. And theſe parts in the miſt are ſo diminute, that indeed they come next to <hi>penetratio corporum. Elementari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um eſt proximè ex elementis.</hi> For we find that they are reſolved into the elements; <hi>ergo</hi> made of them: again they are nouriſhed by the elements, <hi>ergo</hi> made of them; both for matter and forme. Which is thus proved, for they are both <hi>in miſtis,</hi> and of the matter is not made forme, nor of the forme matter: again, thoſe things which have life, their life is main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:115576:241"/> by the elements; and if it be a good reaſoning to ſay, the body is nouriſhed by the elements, <hi>ergo</hi> made of them, 'tis as good to prove the forme to be made of their forms alſo: again, natural, vital, and animal ſpirits are the ſouls of Plants and Beaſts, and are made of the elements; the natural are made in the liver, the vital in the heart, and the animal in the head; and if <hi>animal</hi> be an <hi>univocum genus</hi> to <hi>homo</hi> and <hi>brutum,</hi> it muſt be all in them, and the ſame in them both, for <hi>univocum</hi> is <hi>idemre</hi> and <hi>ratione.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Miſtio</hi> is more than <hi>alteratio;</hi> and yet we cannot call it <hi>generatio,</hi> becauſe there is not <hi>corruptio</hi> which is <hi>veteris formae amiſsio:</hi> but both matter and form are turned into the elements, and for the matter they have one common matter, and they have a campoſite form ariſing from the forms of elements an it ſtill remaineth in the ſame part of the matter that it was in the ſimple. Now in the miſt the forms muſt <hi>ſubigere,</hi> which is by action and paſsion, ſo that there are contraries in every miſt: and in miſts there muſt not be a proportion of the elements in quantity but in act. Conſider <hi>ergo</hi> in every miſtion 1. that there be a proportion of the elements accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to act, 2. that theſe parts are ſo imminute and almoſt indiviſible that they cannot be ſeen; though all the parts in the miſt are not equally minute: for the more formal elements as they are more ſubtil in themſelves ſo alſo more minute in the miſt. And good reaſon tis that theſe ſhould be ſo becauſe theſe muſt act and ſubdue one another: ſo to earth which is the—as it were, comes to air, and there exceding drought and exceeding moiſture fight to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and the air doth as it were rarifie the
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:115576:242"/> earth; now theſe two being contraries will ſoon deſtroy one another if there be not a ſtickler to take up the controverſie betwixt them, <hi>ſcilicet</hi> wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, as before, and to it fire; and ſo theſe make a knot of good fellows. Now theſe parts thus faſtned one upon another, according as they hold together ſuch ſhall be the continuance of the miſt. And theſe acts of the forms of theſe minute parts may be compared to ſo many pins or nayls w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> hold things together: as in the miſt we ſee that fire cannot get out becauſe tis nailed in by water, nor air for tis pinned in by earth. Now for that que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion how the forms become one ſince it remains in the ſame matter, wherin it was before. Tis made one by the mutual act and catching hold one part of another, and ſo in them makes one form. And according to the qualitys of their acts ſhall the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance of the miſt be; as when we ſee two men of equal ſtrenght wraſtle together, they will ſtrugle together a great while before either of them fall: ſo in the elements. from this miſtion comes tempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as we may ſee in hot water being but indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently warme is neither ſo cold as to cool, nor ſo hot as to burn. <hi>Temperamentum</hi> is the reſpect or reference of theſe qualities in the miſt; for the forms of the elements remaining in the miſt and act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing there muſt needs have qualities to proceed from them. Yet theſe acts of the elements in the miſt, are not <hi>in eodem gradu</hi> in the miſt that they are in the elements: for they are reſtrained one by another nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther all <hi>miſta</hi> in that proportion that one ſhould an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer another exactly, for then there could be but one kind of miſture. <hi>Temperametu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> eſt ad pondus vel adjuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiam.</hi>
                  <pb n="123" facs="tcp:115576:242"/> For that <hi>ad pondus</hi> there can be no ſuch found in the world, for this would never corrupt <hi>tempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentum</hi> where there is exceſs of one quality or two; of one quality is ſimple, which is <hi>calidum,</hi> where the hot elements exceed the cold; or <hi>frigidum,</hi> where the cold elements exceed the hot; of two qualities is compoſite, but theſe 2 qualities muſt not be contraries, for they would deſtroy one another, but they muſt be more remiſs and from the exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing act not in extremity of theſe qualities, as in pepper, ginger, &amp;c. have the things their denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. Now there cannot be a temperature wherein three do exceed; for then the fourth would be deſtroyed. And here we ſee there are nine temperatures: firſt that <hi>ad pondus,</hi> of which ſort in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, as before, there is none to be found, yet we do imagine it for the better underſtanding of the reſt; then that wherin one only quality exceeds, and that's of 4 ſorts; or that wherein 2 qualities ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> is of 4 ſorts alſo: Now theſe temperaments have their degrees which though there be infinit of them yet four only obſerved. As in grammer from the letters ariſe varieties of ſillabls and ſo words; ſo from the temperament in nature ariſe ſo many ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars: for theſe temperaments are firſtly of ſimilars, <hi>ergo</hi> the ſimilars being many have not the ſame temperature with the whole, ſor firſt tis of the fimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liars, then of the organical, and laſtly of the whole. Now there is alſo temperature of one thing in regard of another, as of a man with a Lyon we ſay the one is hot or cold in reſpect of the other; for becauſe <hi>miſtum</hi> attends <hi>elementarium,</hi> according to the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of the compoſition divers qualities ariſe. Now
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:115576:243"/> in things compoſed of ſimilar parts only, as worms eels, they <hi>ergo</hi> having their life a-like in every part, hence they live after they be cut, and they have the like temperament: but theſe things that have or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganical parts, when they are cut in peeces, their parts will not live; for the life hath one principal ſeat and is not in every part a-like. Now in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring the temperature of things together if one ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed the other above the common rate we call it a <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> is in heat and moiſture where the heat is only able to ſet it up and make it rotten, and ſo nature is diſſolved and this is general to the elementaries, and to the air and water ſo far forth as they be mingled with vapours; ſo we ſay in ſickneſs-time the air is infected. Now temperature <hi>ad pondus</hi> proves another reaſon: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe in nature it would be fit for no office, as not to cool becauſe heat is equal to it, not to dry becauſe moiſture will hinder it or <hi>contra.</hi> There muſt be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equal proportions of the elements, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly more temperaments, becauſe things are made to diverſs ends, ſo that <hi>ergo</hi> they muſt have elements predominating in them whereby they may be fitted to ſuch and ſuch ends. ſecondly Temperament muſt be unequal, becauſe they muſt be mutable, and there muſt be diſſolution. <hi>Ergo</hi> the temperature muſt be unequal and one element too ſtrong for an other. And theſe predominating elements do ſo much deſtroy themſelves to our ſence as they do by our act, though they do to our ſence alſo, as I can taſt ginger and find it hot. Where one only doth predominate tis either heat, cold, moiſture, or
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:115576:243"/> drith: for as before according to that for which the thing was made ſuch elements ſhall it have predomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nating in it for the attainig of that end: ſo we ſay the heart is naturally hot, for to turn the <hi>chylus</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>chymum,</hi> ſo the brain cold <hi>per ſe</hi> but accidentally hot, which heat is brought from the heart to it by the vital ſpirits: ſo that according to things ends ſo muſt they be made, as bones have drith in them pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dominating, becauſe they are the foundation of the body, even as the earth is the foundation of the world. So again we ſay the four humours cauſed in the liver are fluid, and <hi>ergo</hi> have air predomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in them, becauſe tis their office to run up and downe to nouriſh every part: and for the humours firſt our meat and nutriment comes to our ſtomack and there is turned into <hi>chylus,</hi> and hence it comes into the liver and is turned into <hi>chymum,</hi> and the humours are made of the <hi>ſuccus</hi> of this nutriment in the liver; and of theſe humors is made <hi>ſemen</hi> and that part of the <hi>ſemen</hi> which hath moſt drith in it makes a bone, which is a ſimilar part, and ſo of the reſt. Now in ſome things there are two quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties predominating in reſpect of a double uſe of the thing: and theſe predominting qualities muſt ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more be diſparates, not contraries, for then they would deſtroy one another. Now man of all things comes neereſt to the temperament <hi>ad pondus</hi> and <hi>ergo</hi> he is moſt ſure to mark others temperature being compared with mans temperature. <hi>Craſis</hi> and <hi>temperamentum</hi> are all one. But now the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of temperature are not infinite, but they di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh them into four only: and where any ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is predominate above theſe degrees there is a

               <p>That a man may behave himſelf well, he muſt be <hi>bonis inſtructus,</hi> and they are <hi>totius hominis, aut partis,</hi> i. e. <hi>Corporis</hi> or <hi>animi.</hi> And all theſe are neceſſary that a man may <hi>bene ſe gerere;</hi> and he muſt have the virtues of the mind as <hi>intelligentia</hi> &amp;c. that he may be perfect in the practice of all arts: and whereas the common Philoſophers require only <hi>prudentiam</hi> and <hi>juſtiam univerſalem</hi> indeed all theſe are requiſite. Now follow the vertues of the will and theſe are the cheifeſt of all and are only in <hi>bono:</hi> but now <hi>bonus</hi> may have <hi>gratiam, authoritatem, bona corporis</hi> and <hi>intellectûs</hi> but he muſt be <hi>bonus</hi> that hath <hi>bona voluntatis,</hi> though in <hi>infimo gradu,</hi> and <hi>ergo</hi> theſe vertues do moſt conduce <hi>ad bene ſe geren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum.</hi> So that we ſee as in divinity <hi>ſummum bonum</hi> is the ſubject of the will, ſo alſo in Ethicks will hath his object <hi>bonum.</hi> Now we are to know that Ethicks look at ſuch an one as <hi>Adam</hi> was before his fall, for he was indued with all <hi>bona</hi> both <hi>interna</hi> and <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terna,</hi> both <hi>intellectus</hi> and <hi>voluntatis</hi> ſo that he is our pattern. Now <hi>virtus voluntatis</hi> hath alwayes ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned unto it conſcience, ſo had <hi>Adam</hi> a conſcience to accuſe and excuſe. But what is coneſcince?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> It is ſo much of the Law as yet is in man; or it is the lecture of the underſtanding reading the Law that is in the will. Now for all the diſtinctions in Schools of conſcience as it is good or bad &amp;c. they are falſe; for conſcience is neither good nor bad: but when we do a thing and afterward know it to be evil then we call it an evil conſcience, or if there
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:115576:252"/> be no effect of vertue we call it no conſcience: So that this it is, if a man do evil and his conſcience be againſt it, they ſay it is a bad conſcience and yet this conſcience is good.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Si adſit, excuſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem &amp; haec Voluptatem Praemii expectationem.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That is if it be according to moral vertue it brings with it delight; (not that <hi>voluptatem</hi> which we ſhall heare of hereafter,) and expectation of the reward, for the very natural man wil expect it.</p>

               <p>That is if vertue be abſent there it will whip him; and hence is grief and fear of puniſhment; which is oppoſed to pleaſure and expectation of reward. So <hi>Adam</hi> had his conſcience when he hid him in the garden.</p>
